# Mass media in society
{: .no_toc }

Mass media both reflect and shape their societies. Media and cultural studies both emphasize the social, political, cultural and economic influences of the media in different contexts. 

## News, power

News media in particular potentially play important roles in democracies, particularly when they prioritise the role of informing the public at large, and holding power to account through investigative journalism. As a result news organisations enjoy special protections in countries like South Africa.  South Africa, both state-controlled and commercial mass media underpinned the white supremacist system of apartheid (<a href="references.html#chuma_2019">Wasserman. H. 2020</a>) .

Business models for news media are driven by advertising sales or subscriptions, which means that they are dependent on commercial support and often cater for wealthier readers and viewers who can afford to pay subscriptions and have more buying power. 

Scholars in the political economy tradition have documented how mass media work to deepen economic inequalities and reinforce political, economic and class privileges in capitalist societies. This overlap of economic and media power also applies in African countries despite key differences, such as the limited reach of media and the importance of state media on the continent (<a href="references.html#chuma_2019">Chuma</a>, 2019).  

Furthermore, contemporary media industries tend to be highly concentrated, responding to the political and economic interests of their owners and producing a steady flow of images, stories and information which reproduce the structure of class inequalities and imbalanced power relations that benefit the dominant class (<a href="references.html#harper_nd">Uzuegbunam</a>, 2020). 

## Consumer culture
Advertising media, marketing and branding play a key role in contemporary society. These media industries work hard to tell people what they "need", and what it means when they buy, have, or use certain products. This is known as consumer culture, which is shaped by globalised industries and media as well as  how people make sense of the world in local cultural contexts (<a href="references.html#kurultay_2020"> Kurultay, 2020 </a>).

Around the world, people's values, meanings, and identities develop as they engage in activities associated with consuming goods and services. Despite their cultural power, marketers are not always successful, and need to pay careful attention to how people people often reject or challenge commercial messaging as they negotiate meanings for themselves and work independently to change their societies (<a href="references.html#kurultay_2020"> Kurultay, 2020 </a>)

## Globalisation

Globally, concentrated media ownership has meant the cultural dominance of Western organisations and of the US in particular. (<a href="references.html#mishra_2020"> Mishra, 2020</a>). More recently Bollywood and the broader film industry in India have grown and now entertain millions of viewers globally. </a> In 2007, Nollywood, or the Nigerian movie industry, overtook Hollywood, becoming the second-largest movie producer in the world (<a href="references.html#agbese_2020">Agbese, 2020</a>).

### News media ownership in South Africa

We are surrounded by many different sources of information and media titles. Nonetheless, the ownership of the media
companies which produce most of the media we consume and the social media platforms where we stay in touch with other people
is **highly concentrated**.

For example, South African news media is dominated by "the big four" commercial media companies (Naspers/Media24, Sekunjalo/Independent, Arena Holdings and Caxton) 
which together produce most of the news South Africans encounter every day.

**Naspers (via Media24)** owns the biggest online news platform (News24) as well as many other publications in South Africa. 

Ownership of **technology and social media platforms** is also highly concentrated. 

As a result, most of the news we 
encounter is likely to be found on a few massive websites or apps. Youtube, Google search and the Chrome browser are all owned by **Alphabet**, 
while Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp are all owned by **Meta**. 

### Who owns your news?

Figure 3 reports on a survey (conducted from 2022 to 2024) where CFMS students were asked to share a news article 
or broadcast which they had encountered on that day. 

If you're anything like the participants in this survey, most of the news you encounter was probably published by Naspers.

As Figure 4 shows, the CFMS students who participated in the survey mostly encountered news via
Alphabet's search engine (Google), browser (Chrome), or video hosting site (Youtube).

Now it's your turn to take the survey and see who owns **your** news?
