## thinking about media 

*By Marion Walton, University of Cape Town*

What did you do when you first opened your eyes this morning? What did you do yesterday evening?  

There’s a good chance that your morning and evening rituals involved paying attention to some type of **media**. 

Perhaps in the morning you checked your [social media](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#social_media) timelines for updates from friends on Instagram or to see new trends
on Tiktok, or checked your browser for the news. Perhaps in the evening you settled down to watch a form of [mass media](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#social_media), 
such as a television series on a broadcast or streaming platform. Probably, if you’re like most South Africans, the sound
of a radio or podcast kept you company at some time in the day. 

It's very likely that you used a medium to communicate with others, perhaps an **aural medium** such as  the sound produced when you speak 
(or sing in the shower\!) or a **visual medium** such as your clothing, facial expressions, gestures or sign language.

When do you first remember using media? What role have different languages and different types of media played in your life so far?   What media industries do you find most interesting?

### What are media?

In English, the word **media** evolved from the Latin word *medius* which means "in the middle" (<a href="/ideas/references/index.html#harper_nd">Harper, n.d.</a>). 
In this course we are studying **media of communication**, the physical media, languages and industries which we use to connect with others and to communicate.

We tend to think of media as print or electronic media, but people have been using media to communicate for a very long time.
For example, the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Iziko_Rhino.JPG">"Iziko Rhino"</a> (see Figure 2) is thought to have been created thousands of years ago when someone carefully engraved the image of a rhino
on a rock. The creators of the engraving are thought to be the Later Stone Age ancestors of the ǀXam San at Kinderdam in North West Province, who created images such as this between 1,000 and 10,000 years ago. 
The long-lasting medium of the rock engraving has survived many centuries and still connects contemporary viewers to its original creators despite the destruction of the /Xam society under colonialism. 

The enduring nature of a rock engraving is one of its [**affordances**](/ideas/definitions/index.html#affordance) for communication. 
Another affordance is that the engraving on the rock interacts with its surroundings, so that, at certain times of day, or in certain angles of light,
the engravings may have suddenly become more visible, or may seem to move (e.g. in flickering firelight) ([Hodgskiss & Esterhuysen, 2019](/ideas/references/index.html#hodgskiss_esterhuysen_2019))
We use the term affordance to refer to the potential and constraints of different modes of communication.

Many other communication technologies have been developed, including print media, digital images, audio and video formats,
the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. radio waves and cellphone signals), the internet and generative AI. 


### Oramedia
[**Oramedia**](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#oramedia) 
includes traditionally *oral forms* such as **storytelling, proverbs, folklore, folktales, drama, puppetry 
and oral poetry** (<a href="https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/references/index.html#ugboajah_1985">Ugbuojah, 1985</a>), many of which are only produced using the human body. 

These forms often go beyond the spoken word, using vivid performances, improvisation, mimicry, music, dance, the tonal character of many African languages, and the responses of the 
audience to make the most of the potential affordances of the oral medium ([Finnegan, 2012:5-10](/ideas/references/finnegan_2012))

### What about digital media?

Today many forms of **digital media** are encoded in different formats and depend on a specific configuration of 
**technologies and infrastructure** such as electricity, internet connectivity, 
fibre optic cables, electromagnetic signals transmitted by radio or television broadcasters  or mobile phone signals. Contemporary technologies of
production and distribution mean that it is possible to communicate across long distances
with people around the world. 

In the case of the Iziko Rhino, a Wikipedian working at the Africa Centre in Cape Town published a digital photograph of the rhino engraving
to [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Iziko_Rhino.JPG), a website which allows everyone to contribute and edit
information in encyclopedic format. Now people around the world can see the image.

### What makes social media different?
Social media *platforms* bring together *users, content creators and advertisers,* in many cases on a social media
site or app. Most of these platforms provide tools and functionality for sharing media (text, photos, and videos) with family and friends or 
for entertainment or professional purposes.

**Compare the affordances** of posting a message using (1) email and (2) a social media platform. 

- Which affordances do you appreciate most? 
- Which do you dislike?

### Is AI a form of media?

Generative Artificial Intelligence or [Generative AI](/ideas/definitions/#generative_ai) systems are specialised systems to automate media production by computers.
We call this form of digital media **synthetic media**. Generative AI uses computer [algorithms](/ideas/definitions/index.html#algorithms) to synthesize media using a statistical [*model*](/ideas/definitions/index.html#model),
such as for example, a Large Language Model ([LLM](/ideas/definitions/index.html#llm)) (e.g. ChatGPT) for generating text or a
[diffusion model](/ideas/definitions/index.html#diffusion_model) (e.g. DALL-E) for generating images.

Synthetic media creates many difficulties for us regarding its trustworthiness, bias and [provenance](/ideas/definitions/index.html#provenance). Generative AI can easily be used to bulk generate **spam** or 
targeted **dis- or misinformation** and **deepfakes**. Because such messaging can be generated in bulk it is sometimes referred to dismissively as "**AI sludge**".

What are the most important differences between an AI-generated image of a rhino (see e.g. Figure 2 below) and the Iziko Rhino?
How do you feel when you realise that an image or message was created by AI?

     class="illustration"/>

### Meanings of "media"

When we talk loosely about media, we tend to bundle several senses of the word together - (1) production and distribution (2) communication and (3) media industries or organisations.

#### 1. Media of production, distribution and reception 
We use a wide range of media to produce, distribute or convey messages to one another. We tend to think of electronic or print media first, 
but, as in the case of the rhino engraving in Figure 1, humans have used durable materials
such as rock to communicate with one another throughout history. Other examples of everyday media used to create and distribute
messages include soundwaves, fabrics and paint. 
  
Popular social media apps such as TikTok are both media of production and reception.

#### 2. Medium (mode) of communication 
The phrase "medium of communication" is often used to refer to **human languages** such as isiXhosa, Afrikaans, and English. We tend to use
the word "mode" when we refer to other modes of communication, such as **visuals or music**.

We learn to use languages to make and share meaningful messages with others who have a shared understanding of the linguistic "code". 
These symbolic systems go beyond language and also include the **visual and other modes** of communication which humans 
use to make meaning, such as images, clothing, gestures, expressions or music.

In the case of the Iziko Rhino, the **visual meaning** of the image has many dimensions. 
Some of these dimensions of meaning are based on resemblance. For this reason, we can still recognise the shape of the rhino
if we have encountered rhinos or images of rhinos today. 
Other dimensions of the engraving's meaning are based on the cultural and spiritual significance of the image. Today its significance, 
 when viewed in a museum or on a website would be very different to seeing it in its original context (when it possibly formed part 
of a San spiritual ritual). Thus some dimensions of meaning depend heavily on the context in which the message or image is created or encountered.

#### 3. Media industries and organisations
Often when we talk about "the media" we are referring to the **for-profit media industries**
which have developed around complex media production and distribution networks such as **television broadcasting, news publishers and networks, advertising
and public relations agencies, or social media platforms**.

Media industries tend to be associated with large commercial media organisations which aim to target large audiences
of people, and are thus known as [mass media](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#mass_media). These are
businesses which exist to create and sell media products such as news, advertising, entertainment, or data which can be used 
to target advertising. 

In contemporary society, such organisations are usually primarily motivated to make a **profit**, 
which means they depend on selling subscriptions and advertising. 

In the case of the Iziko Rhino, the image is published on the Wikimedia Commons, which is funded by a **non-profit** foundation, and is thus an example of 
non-commercial media.

Nonetheless, to access Wikimedia we rely on several for-profit industries which produce computers or cellphones or which provide web hosting, electricity and internet access.

### Important definitions

As you learn more about media, you will find yourself using language to talk about media in a more specialised way, 
rather than in the general way used by non-specialists. 

Here are some definitions of terms which you will be using in your work as a media student:

- [Mass media](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#mass_media)
- [Oramedia](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#oramedia)
- [Social media](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#social_media)
- [Synthetic media](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#synthetic_media)

Other important new terms are explained briefly in our list of [definitions](/ideas/definitions/). 
You should be keeping your own glossary, or list of the new words and concepts that you encounter in the course of the semester.
