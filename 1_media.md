What did you do when you first opened your eyes this morning? What did you do yesterday evening?  

## Your media rituals

There’s a good chance that your morning and evening rituals involved paying attention to some type of **media**. 

Perhaps in the morning you checked your [social media](definitions.html#social-media) timelines for updates from friends on Instagram or to see new trends
on Tiktok, or checked your browser for the news. Perhaps in the evening you settled down to watch a form of [mass media](definitions.html#mass-media), 
such as a television series on a broadcast or streaming platform. Probably, if you’re like most South Africans, the sound
of a radio or podcast kept you company at some time in the day. 

It's very likely that you used a medium to communicate with others, perhaps an **aural medium** such as  the sound produced when you speak 
(or sing in the shower\!) or a **visual medium** such as your clothing, facial expressions, gestures or sign language. 

{: .activity}
![Activity](img/pencilpencil.svg) Because we use various forms of media so often, we may not even be aware of everything that goes into accessing and producing them. When do you first remember using media? What role have different languages and different types of media played in your life so far?   What media industries do you find most interesting?

## What are media?
In English, the word **media** evolved from the Latin word _medius_ which means "in the middle" (<a href="references.html#harper_nd">Harper, n.d.</a>). In this course we are studying **media of communication**. 

{: .definition}
Media include the physical media, languages and industries which transmit and encode the messages we use to communicate with one another.

{: .example}
We tend to think of media as print or electronic media, but people have been using media to communicate for a very long time.
For example, the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Iziko_Rhino.JPG">"Iziko Rhino"</a> (see Figure 2) is thought to have been created thousands of years ago when someone carefully engraved the image of a rhino
on a rock. The creators of the engraving are thought to be the Later Stone Age ancestors of the /Xam San at Kinderdam in North West Province, who created images such as this between 1,000 and 10,000 years ago. 
The long-lasting medium of the rock engraving has survived many centuries and still connects contemporary viewers to its original creators despite the destruction of the /Xam society under colonialism.

## Media affordances

{: .definition}
We use the term affordance to refer to the potential and constraints of different modes of communication.

The enduring nature of a rock engraving is one of its [**affordances**](definitions.html#affordance) for communication. 
Another affordance is that the engraving on the rock interacts with its surroundings, so that, at certain times of day, or in certain angles of light, the engravings may suddenly become more visible, or may seem to move in flickering firelight ([Hodgskiss & Esterhuysen, 2019](references.html#hodgskiss_esterhuysen_2019)). 

Many other communication technologies have been developed, including print media, digital images, audio and video formats,
the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. radio waves and cellphone signals), the internet and generative AI. These all have different affordances.

## Oramedia
{: .definition}
[**Oramedia**](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#oramedia) includes traditionally *oral forms* such as **storytelling, proverbs, folklore, folktales, drama, puppetry, spoken word performance and oral poetry** (<a href="references.html#ugboajah_1985">Ugbuojah, 1985</a>), many of which are produced using only the human body. 

These forms often go beyond the spoken word, using vivid performances, improvisation, mimicry, music, dance, the tonal character of many African languages, and the responses of the audience to make the most of the potential affordances of the oral medium ([Finnegan, 2012:5-10](references.html#finnegan_2012))

## Analogue media

Analogue media were created for mass audiences in the pre-digital era. Analogue media include sound recordings on vinyl records (see Figure 2), print newspapers created by physically laying out blocks of type, and analogue radio and television broadcasts. 

## Digital media
{: .definition}
Today many forms of **digital media** are encoded in different formats and depend on a specific configuration of 
**technologies and infrastructure** such as electricity, internet connectivity, fibre optic cables, electromagnetic signals transmitted by radio or television broadcasters  or mobile phone signals. Contemporary technologies of production and distribution mean that it is possible to communicate across long distances with people around the world. 

Digital media also have .In the case of the Iziko Rhino, a Wikipedian working at the Africa Centre in Cape Town published a digital photograph of the rhino engraving to [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Iziko_Rhino.JPG), a website which allows everyone to contribute and edit information in encyclopedic format. Now people around the world can see the image.

## Social media
{: .definition}
Social media *platforms* bring together *users, content creators and advertisers,* in many cases on a social media
site or app. Most of these platforms provide tools and functionality for sharing media (text, photos, and videos) with family and friends or for entertainment or professional purposes.

## AI and Media
{: .definition}
Generative Artificial Intelligence or [Generative AI](definitions.html#generative-ai) systems are specialised systems to automate media production by computers.
We call this form of digital media **synthetic media**. Generative AI uses computer [algorithms](definitions.html#algorithms) to synthesize media using a statistical [*model*](definitions.html#model), such as for example, a Large Language Model ([LLM](definitions.html#llm)) (e.g. ChatGPT) for generating synthetic text or a
[diffusion model](definitions.html#diffusion-model) (e.g. DALL-E) for generating synthetic images.

Synthetic media creates many difficulties for us regarding its trustworthiness, bias and [provenance](definitions.html#provenance). GenAI works by generating a likely response to a prompt, based on patterns in its training data. These responses are thus based on statistically sophisticated guesswork, which means they are often incorrect and likely to be biased in some way.  When used to generate citations, they are simply fabricated likely-looking sources which follow the pattern of the references in its training data.

Generative AI can thus easily be used to bulk generate **spam** or targeted **dis- or misinformation** and **deepfakes**. Because such messaging can be generated in bulk it is sometimes referred to dismissively as "**AI sludge**". 

#Questions

{: .activity}
![Activity](img/pencilpencil.svg) What are the most important differences between an AI-generated image of a rhino (see e.g. Figure 3 below) and the Iziko Rhino depicted in Figure 1? How do you feel when you realise that an image or message was fabricated by AI?

![A synthetic image of a fictitious rhino sculpture produced by OpenAI's DALL-E model](img/DALL-E_iziko_rhino.png)
Figure 3: This synthetic image of a rhino was produced by OpenAI's DALL·E model in response to the prompt 'Picture of Iziko Rhino'. 
 Dalle-E labelled its own synthetic image incorrectly as 'A realistic sculpture of the Iziko Rhino, a famous bronze rhinoceros statue located in Cape Town, South Africa.'

![Screeenshot from Google AI Labs which reads: In 1976, Pink Floyd's song "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2) became an anthem of resistance during the Soweto Uprising, a student-led protest against the apartheid system in South Africa. The song's lyrics resonated with the students' frustration with the Bantu Eudcation system and their fight for educational equality. While the song was released in 1979, it became a powerful symbol of their struggle and was subsequently banned in South Africa due to its association with the protests.](img/google_ai_labs.png)
