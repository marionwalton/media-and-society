What did you do when you first opened your eyes this morning? What did you do yesterday evening?  

There’s a good chance that your morning and evening rituals involved paying attention to some type of **media**. 

## Your media rituals

Perhaps in the morning you checked your [social media](definitions.html#social-media) timelines for updates from friends on Instagram or to see new trends
on Tiktok, or checked your browser for the news. Possibly in the evening you settled down to watch a form of [mass media](definitions.html#mass-media), 
such as a television series on a broadcast or streaming platform. Probably, if you’re like most South Africans, the sound
of a radio or podcast kept you company at some time in the day. 

It's very likely that you used a medium to communicate with others, perhaps an **aural medium** such as  the sound produced when you speak 
(or sing in the shower\!) or a **visual medium** such as your clothing, facial expressions, gestures or sign language. 

{: .activity}
![Activity](img/pencilpencil.svg) Because we use various forms of media so often, we may not even be aware of everything that goes into accessing and producing them. When do you first remember using media? What role have different languages and different types of media played in your life so far?   What media industries do you find most interesting?

## What are media?
In English, the word **media** evolved from the Latin word _medius_ which means "in the middle" (<a href="references.html#harper_nd">Harper, n.d.</a>). In this course we are studying **media of communication**. 

{: .definition}
Media include **physical media** which transmit aural, visual and tactile signals, over six thousand human **languages** and other resources used to convey meanings, and also the contemporary **media industries** such as social media platforms, news organisations,  and television networks. 

These all play important roles in transmitting and encoding messages between people as they communicate with one another.

We tend to think of media as print or electronic media, but people have been using media to communicate for a very long time.

### Example - Iziko Rhino

{: .example}
For example, the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Iziko_Rhino.JPG">"Iziko Rhino"</a> (see Figure 2) is thought to have been created thousands of years ago when someone carefully engraved the image of a rhino
on a rock. The creators of the engraving are thought to be the Later Stone Age ancestors of the /Xam San at Kinderdam in North West Province, who created images such as this between 1,000 and 10,000 years ago. 
The long-lasting medium of the rock engraving has survived many centuries and still connects contemporary viewers to its original creators despite the destruction of the /Xam society under colonialism.

## Media affordances

{: .definition}
We use the term affordance to refer to the potential and constraints of different modes of communication.

The enduring nature of a rock engraving is one of its [**affordances**](definitions.html#affordance) for communication. 
Another affordance is that the engraving on the rock interacts with its surroundings, so that, at certain times of day, or in certain angles of light, the engravings may suddenly become more visible, or may seem to move in flickering firelight ([Hodgskiss & Esterhuysen, 2019](references.html#hodgskiss_esterhuysen_2019)). 

Many other communication technologies have been developed, including print media, digital images, audio and video formats,
the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. radio waves and cellphone signals), the internet and generative AI. These all have different affordances.

[Affordance](definitions.html#affordance){: .btn .btn-blue }

## Oramedia

{: .definition}
[**Oramedia**](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#oramedia) includes traditionally *oral forms* such as **storytelling, proverbs, folklore, folktales, drama, puppetry, spoken word performance and oral poetry** (<a href="references.html#ugboajah_1985">Ugbuojah, 1985</a>), many of which are produced using only the human body. 

Oral forms often go beyond the spoken word, using vivid performances, improvisation, mimicry, music, dance, the tonal character of many African languages, and the responses of the audience to make the most of the potential affordances of the oral medium ([Finnegan, 2012:5-10](references.html#finnegan_2012))

## Analogue media

{: .definition}
Analogue media are created with signals are transmitted in waves, such as light or sound waves.

![Vinyl record](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Motown_7%22_Single_%28Side_1%29.jpg/1282px-Motown_7%22_Single_%28Side_1%29.jpg?20231126212905)
Figure 2: Vinyl record from Motown. Credit - [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Motown_7%22_Single_(Side_1).jpg) 

Analogue media were created for mass audiences in the pre-digital era. Analogue media include sound recordings on vinyl records (see Figure 2), print newspapers created by physically laying out blocks of type, and analogue radio and television broadcasts. 

## Digital media

{: .definition}
Digital media are created using signals expressed as a series of the numbers (digits) 0 and 1. This means that they can be processed by a computer.

Today many forms of **digital media** are encoded in different formats and depend on a specific configuration of 
**technologies and infrastructure** such as electricity, internet connectivity, fibre optic cables, electromagnetic signals transmitted by radio or television broadcasters  or mobile phone signals. Contemporary technologies of production and distribution mean that it is possible to communicate across long distances with people around the world. 

Digital media also have affordances. For example, digital media can be easily copied and transmitted across a computer network. In the case of the Iziko Rhino depicted in [Figure 1](#example---iziko-rhino), a Wikipedian working at the Africa Centre in Cape Town published a digital photograph of the rhino engraving to [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Iziko_Rhino.JPG), a website which allows everyone to contribute and edit information in encyclopedic format. Now people around the world can connect to the internet and see the image.

## Mass media
Mass media are the communication industries which produce information and entertainment products and court the attention of large audiences, which they often sell to advertisers. These include broadcasters, networks, streaming sites, print and digital publishers and a range of other corporate media producers. This is usually what we mean when we talk about “the media”.

## Social media

{: .definition}
Social media *platforms* bring together *users, content creators and advertisers,* in many cases on a social media
site or app. Most of these platforms provide tools and functionality for sharing media (text, photos, and videos) with family and friends or for entertainment or professional purposes.

## AI and synthetic media

{: .definition}
Generative Artificial Intelligence or [Generative AI](definitions.html#generative-ai) systems are specialised systems to automate media production by computers.
We call this form of digital media **synthetic media**. Generative AI uses computer [algorithms](definitions.html#algorithms) to synthesize media using a statistical [_model_](definitions.html#model), such as for example, a Large Language Model ([LLM](definitions.html#llm)) (e.g. ChatGPT) for generating synthetic text or a
[diffusion model](definitions.html#diffusion-model) (e.g. DALL-E) for generating synthetic images.

Synthetic media creates many difficulties for us regarding its trustworthiness, bias and [provenance](definitions.html#provenance). GenAI works by generating a likely response to a prompt, based on patterns in its training data. These responses are thus based on statistically sophisticated guesswork, which means they are often incorrect and likely to be biased in some way.  When used to generate citations, it synthesizes likely-looking sources which follow the pattern of the references in its training data but which may not exist at all.

Generative AI can thus easily be used to bulk generate **spam** or targeted **dis- or misinformation** and **deepfakes**. Because such messaging can be generated in bulk it is sometimes referred to dismissively as "**AI sludge**". 

### Example - GenAI rhino

{: .example}
![A synthetic image of a fictitious rhino sculpture produced by OpenAI's DALL-E model](img/DALL-E_iziko_rhino.png)
Figure 3: This synthetic image of a rhino was produced by OpenAI's DALL-E model in response to the prompt 'Picture of Iziko Rhino'. This synthetic image of a rhino was produced by OpenAI’s DALL·E model in response to the prompt ‘Picture of Iziko Rhino’. DALL-E labelled the synthetic image (_ incorrectly_) as ‘A realistic sculpture of the Iziko Rhino, a famous bronze rhinoceros statue located in Cape Town, South Africa.’

{: .question}
What are the most important differences between an AI-generated image of a rhino (see e.g. Figure 3 above) and the Iziko Rhino depicted in [Figure 1](#example---iziko-rhino)? 

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Answer</summary>

_Verified vs Fabricated_: The Iziko Rhino is a photograph of an actual historical engraving of immense historical value.  
    
By contrast, the synthetic image generated by DALL-E fabricates a generic bronze sculpture in front of a generic neo-classical museum building. Neither of these exist in Cape Town, and there certainly is not a "famous bronze rhinoceros statue" in front of the Iziko museum in Cape Town.
    
_Threatened African tradition vs Dominant Western culture_. The Iziko Rhino engraving was created by /Xam San people many thousands of years ago for specific cultural purposes which we don't necessarily understand very well today. /Xam society was destroyed by European colonialism and so there are no living people who share the artistic and spiritual tradition of these engravings and can explain their significance to us.

By contrast, the synthetic image generated by DALL-E recreates the kind of bronze sculptures from the Western tradition which were more likely to be present in the model's  <a href="definitions.html#training-data">training data</a>.  

This substitution has taken place because /Xam engravings such as the Iziko Rhino were probably not well represented (or represented at all) in DALL-E's training data. In the absence of an Iziko rhino, the model combines the images it associates with Iziko (museum) and with rhino.  When synthesising an image of a rhino, it defaults to a sculpture from the Western realistic tradition of monumental bronze sculpture and reproduces the work of Western sculptors (whose work is more likely to be represented online - and who probably did not give permission for their artwork to be used to train the model). 

Thus the use of GenAI in its current form is likely to further threaten our knowledge about this kind of African aesthetic and cultural tradition and can be seen as an automating Western cultural domination.

### Example - Synthetic search results

{: .example}
Search engines have started to provide synthetic "AI Overviews" or summaries in response to people's search queries. Here is an "AI overview" from Google's Search Labs responding to a question about the association between Pink Floyd's song  "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2) and the Soweto Uprising of 1976:
![Screeenshot from Google AI Labs which reads: In 1976, Pink Floyd's song "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2) became an anthem of resistance during the Soweto Uprising, a student-led protest against the apartheid system in South Africa. The song's lyrics resonated with the students' frustration with the Bantu Eudcation system and their fight for educational equality. While the song was released in 1979, it became a powerful symbol of their struggle and was subsequently banned in South Africa due to its association with the protests.](img/google_ai_labs.png)

{: .question}
![Activity](img/pencilpencil.svg) The "AI Overview" response appears clear enough and reading it is easier than reading through a number of linked websites. Nonetheless it contains a serious factual error. Can you spot the factual error? 

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Answer</summary>
The AI Overview claims
- In 1976, Pink Floyd's song "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2) became an became an anthem of resistance during the Soweto Uprising **(incorrect).**
- The song became associated with the students' struggle in this era and was later banned by the apartheid censorship board. **(correct, but this only happened in 1980).**
- The song was released in 1979. **(correct).**
</details>

{: .question}
Why do you think this error came to be generated? 
<details markdown="block">
<summary>Answer</summary>
The "AI Overview" is synthetic text generated by an LLM. The error is probably related to the internet sources which made up its <a href="definitions.html#training-data">training data</a>. The "AI overview" synthesizes an (incorrect) "summary" by recreating patterns of words which appear on the kinds of websites which mention _both_ the Soweto Uprising and Pink Floyd. These websites probably include many music trivia sites, which record the banning of the famous song but which may not be very historically accurate when referring to the Soweto Uprising and the broader South African student movement. Perhaps South African fans of Pink Floyd also posted online reminiscing about the fact that the famous song was banned in South Africa, and linking this to student protests in general. By contrast, historical sources about June 1976 don't refer to the song. They definitely don't say "'Another Brick in the Wall' did not become an anthem of resistance at this time"!. The perspectives of historians or of Soweto students who participated in the June 1976 Uprising are thus unlikely to be included in the "summary". 
</details>

{: .question}
What does the error show us about the limitations of relying on this kind of artificial "intelligence" as a source? 
<details markdown="block">
<summary>Answer</summary>
The error shows us that the LLM is simply repeating textual patterns from its training data and does not "understand" logical causality or the historical context of the Soweto Uprising. Logically, a song which was only released in 1979 can't have been adopted as an anthem of resistance three years before its release, in 1976. The LLM also doesn't have a contextual understanding of the historical background where the Soweto Uprising took place over a couple of days in 1976 and sparked a broader student movement which continued for several years afterwards.
