What did you do when you first opened your eyes this morning? What did you do yesterday evening?  There’s a good chance that your morning and evening rituals involved paying attention to some type of **media**.

## Your media rituals

Perhaps in the morning you checked your [social media](definitions.html#social-media) timelines for updates from friends on Instagram or to see new trends
on Tiktok, or checked your browser for the news. Possibly in the evening you settled down to watch a form of [mass media](definitions.html#mass-media), 
such as a television series on a broadcast or streaming platform. Probably, if you’re like most South Africans, the sound
of a radio or podcast kept you company at some time in the day. 

It's very likely that you used a medium to communicate with others, perhaps an **aural medium** such as  the sound produced when you speak 
(or sing in the shower\!) or a **visual medium** such as your clothing, facial expressions, gestures or sign language. 

{: .activity}
![Activity](img/pencilpencil.svg) Because we use various forms of media so often, we may not even be aware of everything that goes into accessing and producing them. When do you first remember using media? What role have different languages and different types of media played in your life so far?   What media industries do you find most interesting?

## What are media?
In English, the word **media** evolved from the Latin word _medius_ which means "in the middle" (<a href="references.html#harper_nd">Harper, n.d.</a>). In this course we are studying **media of communication**. 

{: .definition}
Media include **physical media** which transmit aural, visual and tactile signals, over six thousand human **languages** and other resources used to convey meanings, and also the contemporary **media industries** such as social media platforms, news organisations,  and television networks. 

These all play important roles in transmitting and encoding messages between people as they communicate with one another.

We tend to think of media as print or electronic media, but people have been using media to communicate for a very long time.

### Example - Iziko Rhino

{: .example}
For example, the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Iziko_Rhino.JPG">"Iziko Rhino"</a> (see Figure 2) is thought to have been created thousands of years ago when someone carefully engraved the image of a rhino
on a rock. The creators of the engraving are thought to be the Later Stone Age ancestors of the /Xam San at Kinderdam in North West Province, who created images such as this between 1,000 and 10,000 years ago. 
The long-lasting medium of the rock engraving has survived many centuries. The carved line still connects contemporary viewers to its original creators, despite the destruction of the /Xam society under colonialism.

## Media affordances

{: .definition}
We use the term affordance to refer to the potential and constraints of different modes of communication.

The enduring nature of a rock engraving is one of its [**affordances**](definitions.html#affordance) for communication. The rhino engraving at Iziko has lasted over a thousand years.

Another affordance is that the engraving on the rock interacts with its surroundings. For example, at certain times of day, or in certain angles of light, the engravings may suddenly become more visible, or may seem to move in flickering firelight ([Hodgskiss & Esterhuysen, 2019](references.html#hodgskiss_esterhuysen_2019)). 

In subsequent eras, many other communication technologies have been developed, including print media, digital images, audio and video formats,
the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. radio waves and cellphone signals), the internet and generative AI. All these media and communication technologies have different affordances.

## Oramedia

{: .definition}
[**Oramedia**](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#oramedia) includes traditionally *oral forms* such as **storytelling, proverbs, folklore, folktales, drama, puppetry, spoken word performance and oral poetry** (<a href="references.html#ugboajah_1985">Ugbuojah, 1985</a>), many of which are produced using only the human body. 

Oral forms often go beyond the spoken word, using vivid performances, improvisation, mimicry, music, dance, the tonal character of many African languages, and the responses of the audience to make the most of the potential affordances of the oral medium ([Finnegan, 2012:5-10](references.html#finnegan_2012))

## Analogue media

{: .definition}
Analogue media are created with signals are transmitted in waves, such as light or sound waves.

Analogue media were created for mass audiences in the pre-digital era. Analogue media include sound recordings on vinyl records (see Figure 2), print newspapers created by physically laying out blocks of type, and analogue radio and television broadcasts. 

## Digital media

{: .definition}
Digital media are created using signals expressed as a series of the numbers (digits) 0 and 1. This means that they can be processed by a computer.

Today many forms of **digital media** are encoded in different formats and depend on a specific configuration of 
**technologies and infrastructure** such as electricity, internet connectivity, fibre optic cables, electromagnetic signals transmitted by radio or television broadcasters  or mobile phone signals. Contemporary technologies of production and distribution mean that it is possible to communicate across long distances with people around the world. 

Digital media also have affordances. For example, digital media can be easily copied and transmitted across a computer network. In the case of the Iziko Rhino depicted in [Figure 1](#example---iziko-rhino), a Wikipedian working at the Africa Centre in Cape Town published a digital photograph of the rhino engraving to [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Iziko_Rhino.JPG), a website which allows everyone to contribute and edit information in encyclopedic format. Now people around the world can connect to the internet and see the image.

## Mass media
Mass media are the communication industries which produce information and entertainment products and court the attention of large audiences, which they often sell to advertisers. These include broadcasters, networks, streaming sites, print and digital publishers and a range of other corporate media producers. This is usually what we mean when we talk about “the media”.

## Social media

{: .definition}
Social media *platforms* bring together *users, content creators and advertisers,* in many cases on a social media
site or app. Most of these platforms provide tools and functionality for sharing media (text, photos, and videos) with family and friends or for entertainment or professional purposes.

## AI and synthetic media

{: .definition}
Generative Artificial Intelligence or [Generative AI](definitions.html#generative-ai) systems are statistical techniques used to automate media production by computers.

This form of digital media is called **synthetic media**. Generative AI uses computer [algorithms](definitions.html#algorithms) to synthesize media using a statistical [_model_](definitions.html#model). These include Large Language Models ([LLM](definitions.html#llm)) (e.g. ChatGPT) for generating synthetic text or 
[diffusion models](definitions.html#diffusion-model) (e.g. DALL-E, Midjourney) for generating synthetic images.

Generative AI can easily be used to bulk generate **spam** or targeted **dis- or misinformation** and **deepfakes**. Because such messaging can be generated in bulk it is sometimes referred to dismissively as "**AI sludge**".
