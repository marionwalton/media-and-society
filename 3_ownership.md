# Powerful Owners - mass media
{: .no_toc }

Media organisations are often created as a result of **monopolistic** strategies to consolidate their economic power, 
and then purchased by wealthy individuals, who can use them to promote their own financial and ideological interests.

Wealthy individual media owners such as Rupert Murdoch (News Corp) or Jeff Bezos (*The Washington Post*) have used their 
media holdings to exert considerable political and economic power around the globe.

South African billionaire Koos Bekker, former CEO of Naspers, was mentioned at the inquiry into State Capture
as having influenced the transition to digital television in favour of Multichoice. 
![Zapiro cartoon of Koos Bekker, depicted as a thug holding a baseball bat, shows the Multichoice logo edited in graffiti to read "No Choice"](https://w.zapiro.com/cache/com_zoo/images/m_200304dm_1926e60170b0814d181535ed80567a2b.jpg)

Bekker, while not an individual owner, had
considerable shareholding in the organisation.

Iqbal  Survé, owner of Independent Media, frequently appears on the front page of his own 
publications which support his business holdings through Sekunjalo Investments. 
News24 lodged a complaint with the Press Council in 2024 complaining that Independent Media
had invented fictitious personae who were given bylines as fake authors of "op eds" which
attacked individual journalists who had reported critically on Survé's business holdings 
([Wilson et al., 2024](/ideas/references/index.html#references)). 

### Powerful owners - social media

Much as with traditional media, social media platforms are also used by their owners (e.g. Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk) 
to advance their own commercial and political
interests, and to influence which kinds of messages are viewed by their users. 

This conflation of power, wealth, and patriarchy have led to these owners being referred to as
the "**broligarchy**".

In one example, in the runup to the 2024 election, Jeff Bezos is known to have intervened to stop the publication of a *Washington Post* editorial in support of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.

In a more obvious display of power, billionaire Elon Musk bought social media platform Twitter, renamed it "X", and used it to help Donald Trump to win the 2024 US election, gaining the power to promote his ideologies in the new administration as well as on his social media platform.

At Meta, a platfom which had banned Donald Trump in 2020, the shift in power after the 2025 inauguration of Trump, was followed by dramatic changes in moderation
policies on the platforms, as parodied by US comedian, John Oliver:

### Monopolies and ownership

We are surrounded by many different sources of information and media titles. Nonetheless, the ownership of the media
companies which produce most of the media we consume and the social media platforms where we stay in touch with other people
is **highly concentrated**.

For example, South African news media is dominated by "the big four" commercial media companies (Naspers/Media24, Sekunjalo/Independent, Arena Holdings and Caxton) 
which together produce most of the news South Africans encounter every day.

**Naspers (via Media24)** owns the biggest online news platform (News24) as well as many other publications in South Africa. 

Ownership of **technology and social media platforms** is also highly concentrated. 

As a result, most of the news we 
encounter is likely to be found on a few massive websites or apps. Youtube, Google search and the Chrome browser are all owned by **Alphabet**, 
while Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp are all owned by **Meta**. 

### Who owns your news?

Figure 3 reports on a survey (conducted from 2022 to 2024) where CFMS students were asked to share a news article 
or broadcast which they had encountered on that day. 

If you're anything like the participants in this survey, most of the news you encounter was probably published by Naspers.

As Figure 4 shows, the CFMS students who participated in the survey mostly encountered news via
Alphabet's search engine (Google), browser (Chrome), or video hosting site (Youtube).

Now it's your turn to take the survey and see who owns **your** news?
