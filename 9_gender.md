# Gender and representation

Marion Walton and Martha Evans

The goal of this chapter is to understand and challenge **[hegemonic](definitions/hegemony)** models of **sex** and **gender** in the media. We’ll explore the role of gender binaries in everyday language, the visual languages associated with objectification, stereotypes, gender display in advertising and marketing, and gender performativity, and finally ask how and to what extent GenerativeAI is perpetuating existing gender biases. 

As discussed earlier, by "gendered discourse" we mean a range of **practices** which produce categories such as "men", "women" and the relations between them. This includes visual and verbal discourse, as well as how discourse is regulated by social institutions such as advertising and marketing, heteronormative families, single-sex schools, separate sporting codes for men and women, medicine, and so on. These **[multimodal](definitions.html#multimodal)** discursive practices work together with structural racism and other social systems to produce and police subject positions in **intersectional** ways.

We will consider several examples of gender in the media, noticing repeated patterns in **[normative](definitions.html#normativity)** media representations of masculinity and femininity, and in particular the **[binary oppositions](definitions.html#binary-oppositions)** between them. These examples will show how the semiotic details of visual representations such as photographs, advertising and synthetic media are used to construct **gendered identities** and **[ ideologies](definitions.html#ideology)** that may support or challenge **patriarchal social structures**.

## Gender

​​Feminists have traditionally distinguished between the terms “sex” (used to discuss biological issues) and “gender” (referring to culture and signification).

Gender refers to “social and cultural roles, personality traits, and behaviours that are deemed **socially acceptable for men and women** in relation to concepts of masculinity and femininity” ([O’Shaughnessy,  Stadler, & Casey, 2016:360](references.html#oshaughnessy_2016)).

The meanings we associate with femininity have changed over time, as illustrated by  the two Coca-Cola ads. What do they show us about how hegemonic femininities have changed in South Africa since 1956? How do we interpret these identities today? What social changes and governing institutions may have given rise to the change in significations?

The term “gender” was introduced by anthropologist Margaret Mead ([Delphy, 1993](references.html$delphy_1993)) who observed that gender role expectations and the temperaments of men and women in indigenous societies were starkly different to those in the United States at the time.   

 People's understanding of gender changes over time and differs between cultural contexts, as illustrated by the different versions of femininity in the Coca-Cola ads in Figure 1. 

Decolonial scholars have documented how very different gender ideologies and discourses emerge in specific contexts. For example, Oyewumi ([1997](references.html#oyewumi)) argues against imposing Western gender theories (and even the category “woman”) when discussing pre-colonial African societies, noting how scholars interpreted the history of Yoruba society through a patriarchal lens, assuming that leaders were men, while in fact Yoruba women lost many property rights and other powers as a result of colonial rule.

## Binary oppositions

Binary is a mathematical term which describes a numeral system with only two different **symbols** (1 or 0). In language, binary oppositions are a system of opposing and mutually exclusive categories or signifiers. 

| More power | Less power |
|------------|------------|
| Man        | Woman      |
| Rational   | Emotional  |
| Strong     | Weak       |

 These binary oppositions underpin **hegemonic** social hierarchies (e.g. in many contexts “man” has more social power than “woman”, “straight” has more social power than “gay”, “logic” has more social power than “emotion”). 
 
Understanding these binary oppositions in patriarchal discourses can help us to explain many gender **stereotypes**.  

Furthermore, binary categories work together when people try to enforce normative identities. For example, women are expected to be more caring than men, while also being judged for being overly emotional. Because the categories are seen as mutually exclusive, some people find the idea of gender transition a challenging concept. Similarly, when women have physical traits such as muscular shoulders or facial and body hair, this is often enough for people to question their femininity or even their identity as women..

The pressures of binary stereotypes, and the lack of space for non-normative identities is pronounced in languages like English where even personal pronouns specify gender (“he” vs “she”). This is one of the reasons that some people prefer to use gender-neutral pronouns (“they, them”).

## Women and men

When discussing the cultural dimensions of gender, try to avoid the biological terms “male” and “female”, as well as terms which are loaded with sexist assumptions (e.g. “lady”). Instead, use “women” and “men” which refer to people’s **gender identity**. 

It's important to be aware though, that "men" and "women" are often used interchangeably with the biological terms “male” and “female” to construct a **gender binary**. A man/woman opposition is a major organising principle of social and media institutions such as sports and schools, where they are equated with biological terms “male” and “female”.  Used in this binary way, the terms exclude other possible identities, such as trans people who transition from one gender identity to another, as well as the identities of people who identify as **non-binary.** 

Used inclusively, with an awareness of **[intersectionality](definitions.html#intersectionality)** the terms “women” and “men” provide politically useful ways to challenge **sexism and misogyny**, and to encompass critiques of **cis normativity** and **gender binaries**.

## Gender normativity and the media

Gender normativity involves adhering to or reinforcing hegemonic rules and standards about what kinds of behaviour are allowed for men and women. 

For men, gender normativity is often associated with **hegemonic masculinity**. For women it is linked to the dominant and conventionally “womanly” forms of **femininity**.  These ideals change over time and vary in different contexts. An additional important dimension of gender normativity for both men and women is **heteronormativity**.

### Hegemonic femininity

Idealised hegemonic forms of Western femininity (as elsewhere) are often associated with motherhood. While physical beauty is imperative, women’s active sexuality is potentially threatening, and a common target of **misogyny**. Labels which suggest a woman is sexually active tend to be negative, while the same terms for men often have a positive, congratulatory meaning. 

### Hegemonic masculinity

Hegemonic images of men in the media tend to emphasize power (both physical and economic) and victory, in what has been termed phallic masculinity (Gill, 2010). Representations repeat the association of physical strength, power, muscle, heroism, stamina, and endurance with masculinity. Men’s social power is reified, and often takes a physical shape in  visual media. 

### Heteronormativity

Heteronormativity refers to an ideology about heterosexuality as the "normal" or "natural" form of attraction and relationships. This “natural” configuration of relationships is ideologically defined as a relationship between one man and one woman, who both embody conventional gender roles & norms (hegemonic masculinity and feminity), and engage in conventional sexual practices (Barker, 2016:84). These different normativities are related and are kept in place through the associations between a whole set of binary oppositions  e.g. man vs woman, strong vs weak, dominant vs subordinate, gay vs straight. 

## Gender in advertising

Advertising is pervasive and designed to gain attention. As such, this form of media plays an important role in shaping how people conceptualise and feel about gender in contemporary consumer culture. This chapter focuses on advertising as a highly influential aspect of gender representation in the media. 

### Stereotypes

Feminist discussions of advertising have challenged the sexist **stereotypes** of an earlier era, where women were most often represented and interpellated as mothers, housewives, or sex objects. These critiques played a role in shifting advertising away from earlier scripts where **men’s authoritative voices** recommended products to women. The changes in the way of addressing women also acknowledged their important role as consumers. 

### Objectification

Feminists also highlighted the prevalence of **objectification** in advertisements exploiting women’s physical appearance for commercial purposes. These advertisements often borrowed a cinematic style where women’s bodies and appearance were depicted primarily as objects of the “male gaze”. Through such visual traditions, while men gained pleasure in viewing, while (white) women were socialised to be passive and accustomed to being viewed (Laura Mulvey, 1975). 

### Oppositional gaze

The positioning for Black women is more complex. For example, bell hooks (1992) recalls her own experience of viewership and cinema. As a young woman, she did not see herself represented on the screen beyond a set of **narrow stereotypes**. Black women were not even represented as visual objects of desire. hooks’s notion of the “**oppositional gaze**” draws our attention to what is not represented, as well as to the experience and dissenting perspective of Black women as viewers  (bell hooks, 1992). 

### Gender Display 

Erving Goffman (1979) studied large numbers of magazine and billboard advertisements and noticed that they depicted everyday social rituals of what he called “gender display” which constructed scenes of what he termed “female subordination”.  In particular, Goffman noted a **ritualised subordination**, where men and women’s roles repeated a version of the child--parent relationship, with women occupying the position of the child. When both men and women appeared together, the women often held on to the man for support (Goffman, 1979: 40). Even when depicted alone, women often assumed postures expressing this subordination with their bodies unbalanced, their knees canted, heads tilted, their throats exposed, or in half-reclining positions emphasizing vulnerability (Goffman, 1979: 40),

Adverts frequently featured what he termed the “**feminine touch**” (Goffman, 1979: 29-31) where women’s fingers and hands touched, cradled or caressed an object, including self-touching the female body as if it was a precious object. He also noticed ‘**licensed withdrawal’**, when women were depicted in a dreamy state, somewhat removed from what was happening around them.

### Commodity feminism

Women's feminist anger at the often exploitative and potentially harmful pressures of the beauty and fashion industries have been commercially appropriated under **neoliberal post-feminism**.   
This took the form of the **commodity feminisms** which took off as ways appropriate the energy and engagement of online activism in fourth wave feminism. Considered “daring” about 20 years ago, campaigns such as Dove’s "Real Beauty" ads claimed to break traditional media stereotypes and to challenge sexism in culture and language. They also allowed advertisers to respond to “sign fatigue” and skepticism about advertising claims and voice women’s anger about hyper-idealised notions of beauty (Gill, 2010). 

Commodity feminist branding campaigns are fast becoming new normativities, following a script written by groundbreaking campaigns such as Dove's. Such campaigns rewrite a very narrow beauty narrative while still selling their products as being essential for women to achieve appropriate levels of (**post-feminist**) self-esteem. This is also known as "**femvertising**".  Examples of these include the Dove, Nike, and L'Oreal "Statements of Worth" campaigns.

Media and cultural studies perspectives emphasize how media and beauty brands have been and still are highly complicit with gendered **normativities** requiring all women and particularly Black women to engage in considerably more **aesthetic labour** than men do, while also spending a large amount of their income on beauty products, often in the guise of "self-care". 

While both visual and verbal languages reflect and perpetuate social inequalities, people are always developing new language and semiotic resources and using them to bring about social change. Your creative project will use still images and draw on gender codes and discourses to appeal to its target market, and so we’ll look in  more detail at how print advertising has traditionally relied on a visual language which often subordinates women (Goffman, 1979).

### Masculinity in advertising

A **hyper-masculine** form of masculinity dominates many action film narratives, as well as games, and these narratives are also sometimes found in adverts. 

The message here is that masculinity solves problems with physical power, and physical violence in some cases. These dominant representations of masculinity tend to allow men a limited emotional range, which finds approved emotional outlets in sporting contests and rage-fuelled physical conflict. 

Masculinity is also intersectional. Hypermasculine qualities such as physical strength and anger may be depicted as toxic, criminal or threatening when combined with racial and class signifiers.

Visual culture has shifted, and men’s bodies are now often also on display. Influenced by feminist movements, the queer movement, and the need to build new markets, **masculinity is objectified** to a far greater extent than in a previous era. These images are a sign of advertisers cultivating and catering to particularly masculine insecurities.

## Gender bias and AI

GenerativeAI tends to perpetuate the biases in its training data. Gender bias is a serious concern for feminist media researchers. Various kinds of representational harms are generated because of the way these models work. 

Black feminist researchers have played a leading role in highlighting these concerns. 

### Bias in computer vision

Computer vision researchers warned early on that black faces were not even recognised as human, and that  facial recognition did not recognise black women's faces (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018) 

### Bias in LLMs
As language models grew larger, Bender, Gebru, et al. (2021)  warned that synthetic text generation could reproduce systems of oppression in addition to spreading misinformation, and creating negative environmental and socio-economic impacts. 

These risks related to the way language models rely on training data from undocumented datasets filled with hegemonic viewpoints, and collected with no accountability. 

Gender stereotypes in linguistic data have been shown to be associated with stereotypical viewpoints and implicit judgements (Lewis, Molly, and Gary Lupyan. 2020.) Language models tend to reproduce and perpetuate such stereotypes, and have been associated with unfair discrimination, exclusionary norms, and toxic language, (Weidinger, Mellor & Rauh, et al., 2021). They also do not perform as well with less globally dominant languages.

Sources of bias include:
- Structural bias
- Activity bias
- Data (sample/selection) bias
- Confirmation bias

### Gender in marked and unmarked terms

In English, normative gender identities tend to go unmarked, while non-normative gender identities are often explicitly marked, either by the use of a specific gendered term (e.g. in the past “actress” was used for women actors) or by using adjectives (e.g. “woman engineer”, “gay wedding” or “a strong, independent woman”. In such cases, the default or unmarked state (“actor”, “engineer”, "wedding”, "woman") is the normative identity (which usually goes without saying and thus doesn’t need to be stated explicitly e.g. a “\[male\] actor or engineer”, “\[straight\] wedding” or a “\[weak, dependent\] woman”). 

The idea of an unmarked term refers to how the labels for people reflect social biases in the meanings of language. Unmarked terms (actor, nurse) and marked terms (actress, male nurse) name occupations and reflect social inequalities and norms about the gender of people in those occupations. Marginalised social categories tend to be marked (e.g. gay wedding), while dominant perspectives often aren’t specified in the same way (people seldom talk about a “straight wedding”). 

Culturally unmarked qualities are taken for granted and carry meanings which are almost too obvious to state (“that goes without saying"). Choosing to use a marked or unmarked term thus signifies your perspective and social context e.g. if you belong to a Muslim family and are chatting to your family about a cousin’s wedding, you probably wouldn’t mark this identity, since it “goes without saying” in this context.

Gender normativity means “adhering to or reinforcing hegemonic, normative standards of masculinity or femininity”. 
Heteronormativity assumes the "normal" relationship is between one man and one woman, embodying conventional gender roles & norms (hegemonic masculinity and femininity) (Barker, 84). Such normativities are kept in place through associations between binary oppositions  e.g. man vs woman, strong vs weak, dominant vs subordinate. 

### Race and Gender 

Midjourney generated weddings of white couples in this example. 

Reflecting gender stereotypes, the unmarked term “soldier” is associated with men, while the unmarked term “model” is associated with women. 

The unmarked identities in the prompt were "model" (all women) and "soldier" (all men). 

The women depicted were all examples of hegemonic femininity (brides/models), while the images of men in most cases represented hegemonic masculinity (grooms/soldiers). 

### Culture
In Figure 2, Midjourney interpreted the prompt as a wedding scene using the traditional dress for a "white" Western/Christian wedding, rather than representing the wedding costumes of any other tradition. 

### Heteronormativity

The weddings are all heteronormative weddings between a man (or masculine presenting person) and a woman (or feminine presenting person). 

### Generating poses

Poses and interaction tend to reflect normative gendering and wedding pics conform to the ritualised subordination of femininity familiar from Goffman's study of gender display in advertising. So for example, notice the differences in height between men and women and exaggerated power differences in many poses. 

### Versions of masculinity

There are several incongruities linked to outputs where signifiers suggest an inappropriate version of masculinity, since some soldiers are depicted in action on the battlefield, rather than wearing military dress uniform to a wedding ceremony. Bombed buildings, warfare, weapons and a violent version of hyper-masculinity reflect training data which included documentary, film or historical treatment of war. These details are both jarring and amusing in the context of a wedding celebration.
