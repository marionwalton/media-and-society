## Gender in advertising

Advertising is pervasive and designed to gain attention. As such, this form of media plays an important role in shaping how people conceptualise and feel about gender in contemporary consumer culture. This chapter focuses on advertising as a highly influential aspect of gender representation in the media. 

### Stereotypes

Feminist discussions of advertising have challenged the sexist **[stereotypes](definitions.html#stereotype)** of an earlier era, where women were most often represented and interpellated as mothers, housewives, or sex objects. These critiques played a role in shifting advertising away from earlier scripts where men’s authoritative voices recommended products to women. The changes in the way of addressing women also acknowledged their important role as consumers. 

### Objectification
{: .definition}
Objectification is the act of treating or viewing a person  and especially a woman, _as an object_. In many cases this refers to sexual objectification, where women are reduced to their bodies or appearance, are identified with their body, or parts of their body.  

Feminists also highlighted the prevalence of **[objectification](definitions.html#objectification)** in advertisements exploiting women’s physical appearance for commercial purposes. These advertisements often borrowed a cinematic style where women’s bodies and appearance were depicted primarily as objects of the “male gaze”. Through such visual traditions, while men gained pleasure in viewing, while (white) women were socialised to be passive and accustomed to being viewed ([Mulvey, 1975](references.html#mulvey_1975)). 

### Oppositional gaze

The positioning for Black women is more complex. For example, [bell hooks (1992)](references.html#hooks_1992) recalls her own experience of viewership and cinema. As a young woman, she did not see herself represented on the screen beyond a set of narrow **[stereotypes](definitions.html#stereotype)**. Black women were not even represented as visual objects of desire. hooks’s notion of the “**[oppositional gaze](definitions.html#oppositional-gaze)**” draws our attention to what is not represented, as well as to the experience and dissenting perspective of Black women as viewers . 

{: .definition}
The oppositional gaze refers to a space of viewer resistance and a critical perspective on mass media's lack of meaningful Black representation.

### Gender Display 

Erving Goffman (1979) studied large numbers of magazine and billboard advertisements and noticed that they depicted everyday social rituals of what he called “**gender display**” where the ads constructed scenes of “female subordination”.  In particular, Goffman noted a **ritualised subordination**, where men and women’s roles repeated a version of the child--parent relationship, with women occupying the position of the child. When both men and women appeared together, the women often held on to the man for support (Goffman, 1979: 40). Even when depicted alone, women often assumed postures expressing this subordination with their bodies unbalanced, their knees canted, heads tilted, their throats exposed, or in half-reclining positions emphasizing vulnerability ([Goffman, 1979: 40](references.html#goffman_1979)),

Adverts frequently featured what he termed the “**feminine touch**” ([Goffman, 1979: 29-31](references.html#goffman_1979)) where women’s fingers and hands touched, cradled or caressed an object, including self-touching the female body as if it was a precious object. He also noticed ‘**licensed withdrawal’**, when women were depicted in a dreamy state, somewhat removed from what was happening around them.

### Commodity feminism

Women's feminist anger at the often exploitative and potentially harmful pressures of the beauty and fashion industries have been commercially appropriated under **[neoliberal postfeminism](definitions.html#postfeminism)**.   
In marketing and advertising, **commodity feminisms** took off as ways appropriate the energy and engagement of online activism in fourth wave feminism. Considered “daring” about 20 years ago, campaigns such as Dove’s "Real Beauty" ads claimed to break traditional media stereotypes and to challenge sexism in culture and language. They also allowed advertisers to respond to “sign fatigue” and skepticism about advertising claims and voice women’s anger about hyper-idealised notions of beauty ([Gill, 2010](references.html#gill_2010)). 

Commodity feminist branding campaigns are fast becoming new normativities, following a script written by groundbreaking campaigns such as Dove's. Such campaigns rewrite a very narrow beauty narrative while still selling their products as being essential for women to achieve appropriate levels of (**post-feminist**) self-esteem. This is also known as "**femvertising**".  Examples of these include the Dove, Nike, and L'Oreal "Statements of Worth" campaigns.

Media and cultural studies perspectives emphasize how media and beauty brands have been and still are highly complicit with gendered **normativities** requiring all women and particularly Black women to engage in considerably more **aesthetic labour** than men do, while also spending a large amount of their income on beauty products, often in the guise of "self-care".

### Masculinity in advertising

{: .definition}
Hypermasculinity exaggerates male stereotypical behavior, such as an emphasis on physical strength, aggression, and human male sexuality.

**Hypermasculinity** dominates many action film narratives, as well as games, and these narratives are also sometimes found in adverts. 

The message here is that masculinity solves problems with physical power, and physical violence in some cases. These dominant representations of masculinity tend to allow men a limited emotional range, which finds approved emotional outlets in sporting contests and rage-fuelled physical conflict. 

Masculinity is also intersectional. As discussed above, **hypermasculine** qualities such as physical strength and anger may be depicted as toxic, criminal or threatening, particularly when combined with racial and class signifiers.

Visual culture has shifted, and men’s bodies are now often also on display. Influenced by feminist movements, the queer movement, and the need to build new markets, masculinity is **[objectified](definitions.html#objectification)** to a far greater extent than in a previous era. These images are a sign of advertisers cultivating and catering to particularly masculine insecurities.
