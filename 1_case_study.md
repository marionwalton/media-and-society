### Example - GenAI rhino

{: .example}
![A synthetic image of a fictitious rhino sculpture produced by OpenAI's DALL-E model](img/DALL-E_iziko_rhino.png)
Figure 3: This synthetic image of a rhino was produced by OpenAI's DALL-E model in response to the prompt 'Picture of Iziko Rhino'. This synthetic image of a rhino was produced by OpenAI’s DALL·E model in response to the prompt ‘Picture of Iziko Rhino’. DALL-E labelled the synthetic image (_ incorrectly_) as ‘A realistic sculpture of the Iziko Rhino, a famous bronze rhinoceros statue located in Cape Town, South Africa.’

{: .question}
What are the most important differences between an AI-generated image of a rhino (see e.g. Figure 3 above) and the Iziko Rhino depicted in [Figure 1](1_media.html#example---iziko-rhino)? 

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Answer</summary>

_Verified vs Fabricated_: The Iziko Rhino is a photograph of an actual historical engraving of immense historical value.  
    
By contrast, the synthetic image generated by DALL-E fabricates a generic bronze sculpture in front of a generic neo-classical museum building. Neither of these exist in Cape Town, and there certainly is not a "famous bronze rhinoceros statue" in front of the Iziko museum in Cape Town.
    
_Threatened African tradition vs Dominant Western culture_. The Iziko Rhino engraving was created by /Xam San people many thousands of years ago for specific cultural purposes which we don't necessarily understand very well today. /Xam society was destroyed by European colonialism and so there are no living people who share the artistic and spiritual tradition of these engravings and can explain their significance to us.

By contrast, the synthetic image generated by DALL-E recreates the kind of bronze sculptures from the Western tradition which were more likely to be present in the model's  <a href="definitions.html#training-data">training data</a>.  

This substitution has taken place because /Xam engravings such as the Iziko Rhino were probably not well represented (or represented at all) in DALL-E's training data. In the absence of an Iziko rhino, the model combines the images it associates with Iziko (museum) and with rhino.  When synthesising an image of a rhino, it defaults to a sculpture from the Western realistic tradition of monumental bronze sculpture and reproduces the work of Western sculptors (whose work is more likely to be represented online - and who probably did not give permission for their artwork to be used to train the model). 

Thus the use of GenAI in its current form is likely to further threaten our knowledge about this kind of African aesthetic and cultural tradition and can be seen as an automating Western cultural domination.

### Example - Synthetic search results

{: .example}
Search engines have started to provide synthetic "AI Overviews" or summaries in response to people's search queries. Here is an "AI overview" from Google's Search Labs responding to a question about the association between Pink Floyd's song  "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2) and the Soweto Uprising of 1976:
![Screeenshot from Google AI Labs which reads: In 1976, Pink Floyd's song "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2) became an anthem of resistance during the Soweto Uprising, a student-led protest against the apartheid system in South Africa. The song's lyrics resonated with the students' frustration with the Bantu Eudcation system and their fight for educational equality. While the song was released in 1979, it became a powerful symbol of their struggle and was subsequently banned in South Africa due to its association with the protests.](img/google_ai_labs.png)

{: .question}
![Activity](img/pencilpencil.svg) The "AI Overview" response appears clear enough and reading it is easier than reading through a number of linked websites. Nonetheless it contains a serious factual error. Can you spot the factual error?

<summary>Answer</summary>
The AI Overview claims
- In 1976, Pink Floyd's song "Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2) became an became an anthem of resistance during the Soweto Uprising **(incorrect).**
- The song became associated with the students' struggle in this era and was later banned by the apartheid censorship board. **(correct, but this only happened in 1980).**
- The song was released in 1979. **(correct).**
</details>

{: .question}
Why do you think this error came to be generated? 
<details markdown="block">
<summary>Answer</summary>
The "AI Overview" is synthetic text generated by an LLM. The error is probably related to the internet sources which made up its <a href="definitions.html#training-data">training data</a>. The "AI overview" synthesizes an (incorrect) "summary" by recreating patterns of words which appear on the kinds of websites which mention _both_ the Soweto Uprising and Pink Floyd. These websites probably include many music trivia sites, which record the banning of the famous song but which may not be very historically accurate when referring to the Soweto Uprising and the broader South African student movement. Perhaps South African fans of Pink Floyd also posted online reminiscing about the fact that the famous song was banned in South Africa, and linking this to student protests in general. By contrast, historical sources about June 1976 don't refer to the song. They definitely don't say "'Another Brick in the Wall' did not become an anthem of resistance at this time"!. The perspectives of historians or of Soweto students who participated in the June 1976 Uprising are thus unlikely to be included in the "summary".

{: .question}
What does the error show us about the limitations of relying on this kind of artificial "intelligence" as a source? 
<details markdown="block">
<summary>Answer</summary>
The error shows us that the LLM is simply repeating textual patterns from its training data and does not "understand" logical causality or the historical context of the Soweto Uprising. Logically, a song which was only released in 1979 can't have been adopted as an anthem of resistance three years before its release, in 1976. The LLM also doesn't have a contextual understanding of the historical background where the Soweto Uprising took place over a couple of days in 1976 and sparked a broader student movement which continued for several years afterwards.

![Activity](img/pencilpencil.svg) Given the problems with this synthesised summary, how should we  approach AI overviews when looking for information with a search engine or using Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT)?
