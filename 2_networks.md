# Understanding Networks
{: .no_toc }

*By Marion Walton, University of Cape Town*

We can't understand contemporary media without exploring how people use media in their interpersonal
networks, and how media products flow around [networks](/ideas/definition/index.html#network) in the process of communication.

## What is a network?

![Illustration of nodes connected in a network](https://cdn.glitch.global/cf95248c-36c9-4c16-8fd1-053cbc9fd048/Screenshot%202025-02-25%20at%2017.05.05.png?v=1740517367370 "illustration")
Figure 1: Nodes connected in a network

A network can be defined as any system of relationships ([Chandler & Munday,2020a](/ideas/references/index.html#chandler_munday_2020a))
which may represent relationships between people and things, or between words and other semiotic resources.

Long before the invention of Facebook or TikTok, social scientists thought about
**social networks** as the web of **social relationships** (known as "ties") between individuals 
(see e.g. [Granovetter,1973](/ideas/references/index.html#granovetter_1973)).

Using **network theory**, we map media networks as a system of interconnected **nodes**, where the nodes
may be social media users or posts, such as videos on Youtube, 

Computer networks rely on telecommunications systems and physical infrastructure (such as **connections between computers** on
the internet or cellphones in cellphone networks) to link computers and transfer [data](/ideas/2_data/) 
(such as the internet). 

**User profiles interconnected with one another** are the networks which structure social media
platforms. We sometimes talk about these platform-based networks as "social networks". In fact the term "social network" 
refers to many different forms of social connectedness in our everyday lives, including but not limited to our use of 
social platforms.

Finally, we can also think of networks of **interconnected content**, such as videos or posts connected
by the same hashtags, television series watched by the same people, 
individual words connected to one another on the internet, or clusters of similar images. (These networks
are represented in the models used by [Generative AI](/ideas/definitions/index.html#generative_ai).)


## Social listening

On social media, official branding strategies now co-exist with **many-to-many conversations** where consumers get together to discuss
products, which may or may not always cohere with the official brand identities companies pay to create. 

This has led companies to adopt **digital marketing strategies**, where part of their market research 
involves paying attention
to what people are saying about them online. This is known as **social listening**, and can help brands
pick up specific issues with their products, or highlight the existence of a niche of customers who have different needs.

## Representing networks

Figure 2 shows how many hundreds of Youtube videos match a query for "KFC" and "South Africa". 
By mapping the connections between all the different tags which appear together on the videos, 
it is possible to identify "clusters" or broad areas and topics of conversation around the brand.

The diagram maps the tags on the videos, and 
the galaxy-like structure suggests a large number of sometimes overlapping 
conversations.

## Going "viral"

The following Youtube videos all gained a great deal of attention, and can be seen as slightly larger nodes in the larger clusters around the KFC brand in the networks represented above .

Watch the videos below, look carefully at their metrics (views, likes and comments) and try to decide why each video "*went viral*"".

Youtube has more than 2 billion users and the platform can be used effectively to target a **niche**, or a 
small subset of Youtube users by interacting with a relatively small and yet well-defined and often highly engaged
and loyal audience. Example 4 shows an example of a South African content creator who has successfully reached
a niche global audience. How much do you think she would be able to earn from her channel?


In this case, Example 3 is targeted at a global audience of people with a niche interest, "*mukbang*" videos. 

*Mukbang* as a genre originally arose in Korea (the term combines the Korean words for "to eat" and "broadcast").

The genre is sought out by people who enjoy watching and listening to the sound effects of someone eating large quantities of
food, often in competitive challenges. 

In the case of Example 3, the budget to produce the content was relatively low, but the video has received more than 300 000 views, 
which means that the content can be **monetised** by the creator, i.e. they receive payments directly from Youtube (or another platform).

Even small individual content creators can earn substantial amounts of money from **monetising** their content in this way.  

In South Africa, popular creators may be able to earn between R1,826 and R1,402,918 per month. The main source
of this revenue is advertising. The huge range in earnings reflects the way in which demand for content depends on which audiences
it can attract, and whether it is likely to sell popular consumer products.

Videos which attract large numbers of likes, comments, or shares (known as higher **engagement**) and which **keep viewers
watching for longer** are more likely to attract advertising. As with television advertising, the amount of income made from a piece of content
depends on the social and economic power of the audiences who are
targeted by the content.

Creators can also earn from sponsorships by brands which partner with them, or directly from subscriptions ([Zwane, 2024](/ideas/references/index.html#zwane_2024)).

Advertising income 
depends on **CPM (cost per mille)**, which is the amount which advertisers are prepared to pay to reach 1000 viewers.Viewers from countries with stronger currencies attract a much higher CPM on average, as suggested by this table:

|Country|Average CPM (USD)|
|----|-----|
|USA| $2.00|
|UK| $1.50|
|India|	$0.20|

For example, 1000 views from YouTube users in the USA could earn someone 2 USD, By contrast, it would require 10 000 views from 
users in India to achieve the same level of income. 

Just as there is more of a financial incentive to create television
news and programming which targets affluent audiences, the content produced for social media platforms is also 
biased towards serving the interests of these relatively powerful social groups. 

Higher earning content categories are those which focus on consumption-related topics
such as Education, Tech, Finance, Beauty and Lifestyle ([Zwane, 2024](/ideas/references/index.html#zwane_2024)).

## Influence industry

Global brands and corporations have historically relied on spending large amounts of money on public 
relations to attract the attention of the media, and on advertising and advertorial to influence how stories are told to the public. 

This **influence industry** extends beyond marketing to the world of politics, international relations and even warfare. In this murky 
area of contemporary politics, computational **propagandists** use social media to target ads to specific groups of voters in campaigns
intended to drum up support for particular political candidates and harass their opponents (Woolley, 2023).

Their techniques include manipulating algorithms to make sure that their carefully designed persuasion and deceptive content will 
feature on lists of ‚Äútrending‚Äù topics. They also pay influencers in carefully chosen niches to artificially boost their  content and
make it appear that they have a groundswell of popular support (Woolley, 2023).

Gaining attention in this environment is not easy for everyone who wants to build an audience or mobilise supporters. The budgets of 
such commercial players and bad faith propagandists far exceed those of ordinary people. 

## Astroturfing

Network dynamics can also be used unethically or deceptively, where coordinated campaigns are mounted to simulate 
a conversation (**astroturfing**) with the goal of indirectly influencing
public opinion and feelings about the client of the campaign by encouraging, seeding, and even faking
certain kinds of favourable conversations (or unfavourable conversations about rivals).

Inauthentic coordinated campaigns can consist of posts by "bots" (often created with 
generative AI), or of human-created "posts for hire" where users who may 
be employees of a "content farm" in a different country are paid directly 
to post content, which then appears with no disclaimer or "sponsored" label.

# Questions

Watch the videos above: 
- Why do you think each video went viral?
- Which video do you think earned most money? Why?
- Are there any differences between their metrics which you find interesting (hint - look at the **ratios** between views, likes and comments)?
- Have you ever encountered media which you suspect was produced synthetically (by a "bot")?
