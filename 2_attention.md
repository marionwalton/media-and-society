## attention & influence
*By Marion Walton, University of Cape Town*

The ability for millions of people to create and share content with one another has caused a major shift in media industries. 

### One to many

The **one-to-many** model of **mass media** was dominant in the era when the media landscape consisted of broadcasters and newspapers. 
Here **one sender** sent messages to **many** **receivers**. 

One way of describing this era is to say that mass media industries had a **monopoly on attention** 
([Tufekci, 2013](/ideas/references/index.html#tufekci_2013)). This led to their considerable social [power](/ideas/3_power/) and
and meant that our ideas of a [public](/ideas/3_publics/) have been shaped by the audiences of news publications and
broadcasters.

In this era, **one-to-one** communication was traditionally used mainly for 
interpersonal communication. Phone calls and messages generally have **one sender** and **one receiver**, with two people taking 
turns in each role. 

### Many to many

![network](https://cdn.glitch.global/cf95248c-36c9-4c16-8fd1-053cbc9fd048/Screenshot%202025-02-25%20at%2017.15.44.png?v=1740517371995)

In the current era, these two models have **converged** into a **many-to-many** model of the internet 
and most social media platforms. 

On these platforms there are many more sources of information and entertainment than anyone could possibly process in a lifetime.

Crucially, **anyone with access to the internet can also send messages**. 

This many-to-many model means that increasingly, we are confronted with an abundance of sources of media and entertainment 
which all vie for our **limited time and attention**. This is known as a **high choice media environment** ([Shehata & Str√∂mb√§ck,2021](/ideas/references/index.html#shehata_and_str√∂mb√§ck_2021)).

### New monopolies and intermediaries

At the same time, **new monopolies** have emerged, those of the so-called "tech giants", or the
social platforms, search engines, and increasingly the generative models and "AI" chatbots which
**aggregate** indices of websites (Google/Alphabet), collect e-commerce products 
(Amazon) or social media profiles (Facebook/Meta, Twitter/X), and use statistics to model and vast collections of 
text and other media (Gemini/Alphabet, OpenAI). 

As a result, no matter what we are interested in, we are likely to access it via one of these platforms.

For this reason, we can think of these platforms as **intermediaries**.

### Who speaks? And who is heard?

In the past it was most important for media studies to answer the question: "**who speaks?**", as those who could 
command attention in print and in broadcast media found it easy to monopolise power. 

Now, because it is possible
for so many people to have a say using social media, we also need to understand **whose voices are heard** and how **attention is distributed** 
in our society. 

**If everyone is speaking, who is listening?**

### Attention as commodity

As a result of the change to a many-to-many model of communication, people‚Äôs attention has become a **valuable commodity** 
and many platforms aim to hold their users‚Äô attention as long as possible and to get them to engage with content as much as possible. 

Historically,  **advertising and marketing** industries have been prepared to pay large amounts of money to attract the attention 
of many people via **mass media**. In turn, the mass media have gravitated towards the kinds of programming which caters to a wide
range of people, or which (from a marketer‚Äôs perspective), appeal to a mass market without causing too many controversies. 

### Attention and television

For this reason, television executives pay careful attention to **audience data**, or information about who watches which programs, 
and what rates advertisers are prepared to pay to reach particular **demographic groups**. They use this information to make predictions regarding
how profitable a show might be for a network. These metrics commonly include how many people watched the show, what focus groups 
thought about it, and whether advertisers were keen to advertise to that audience. 

### Case studies

What strategies do these television ads use to gain attention? What audiences do you think they were targeting and why? What shows you that?

### Mass audiences

Historically (in the one-to-many model) advertisers who want to bring their product to the attention of the widest possible audiences of consumers need to pay television networks a lot of money
(e.g. SABC, DSTV, Supersport in South Africa) to flight advertisements such as the examples above. Typically they pay for short advertising "spots" 
(30 seconds \- 2 minutes).

These television "spots" (such as the case study ads above) will be displayed during television broadcasts that are popular 
with the kind of people likely to buy the advertiser's products  (‚Äútarget audiences‚Äù). 
The rates advertisers pay are determined by the size of the audience, how affluent the viewers are (advertisers pay
more to reach affluent audiences),  the length of the spot (longer = more expensive), and how often it is flighted
(networks often offer bulk discounts which include other branding opportunities to advertisers). 

In the case of **Example 1**, the ad was screened to SA audiences during sports broadcasts 
on the pay TV channel Supersport. Such spots can cost hundreds of thousands for a bulk package on a single network (advertisers would probably flight the ad on a couple of networks).

To reach even bigger audiences these rates can be even more expensive. For example in 2022, advertisers needed to spend over 6.5 million U.S. dollars 
(R117 337 610) for a 30 second advertising spot during the U.S. Super Bowl, an annual U.S. football game which attracts the largest audiences on U.S. television.

### Television delivers people?

The steep price tag of these television advertisements illustrates how the mass media sells people‚Äôs attention to advertisers. 

This point is highlighted in a video by artist Richard Serra ([1973](/ideas/references/index.html#serra_1973)) entitled ‚ÄúTelevision Delivers People‚Äù: 

>You are the product of t.v.  
You are delivered to the advertiser who is the customer.  

Serra‚Äôs artwork brings home a powerful point. Television, as a commercial medium, is driven by advertising. Advertising seeks out and cultivates specific 
audiences as potential consumers for its products. The interests of the advertisers tends to shape 
the nature of the programming on offer.

Nonetheless, Serra‚Äôs account leaves out some important details. 


### Attention vs control

Unfortunately for advertisers, our attention is not actually a commodity which is so easily bought and sold. 
Media researchers have found that it is not so easy to control what people think ([Hall, 2006](/ideas/references/index.html#hall_2006)). 

Nonetheless, the media can be highly influential in determining **what people attend to**. In the world of news, 
this is known as **agenda-setting** ([McCombs & Shaw, 1972](/ideas/references/index.html#mccombs_and_shaw_1972).

Furthermore, given the competing demands on our attention in a many-to-many era, 
it‚Äôs increasingly difficult for media to direct the public's attention in this way. 
As we will see when we discuss [networks](/ideas/2_networks/), increasingly marketers are targeting smaller or **niche**
audiences.

If, as Serra claims, we are ‚Äúproduced‚Äù by the ad-supported television we‚Äôve watched, how is it possible then, 
that so many people have learned to tune out advertising and younger generations in particular, 
have become highly skeptical about its claims? When we use web browsers, why do so many people go 
to so much trouble to block advertisements completely, or opt to pay more for ad-free subscription 
services such as Netflix or Youtube Music? 


### Branding

People‚Äôs responses to advertising are somewhat unpredictable. Nonetheless, the mass media are largely commercial businesses 
which operate within a capitalist system, and one of their primary goals is to influence our behaviour by drawing our attention 
to **products and services**, through **advertising, sponsorships, promotions, advertorial (ads which look like news stories) and 
product placement** (where products are presented to audiences as a part of the entertainment content they consume, such as a film or television series).

This media environment certainly does not control what we think, but through these and other **branding** strategies it can influence how a 
carefully targeted audience might **feel** about specific products . The sheer volume of commercial messages around us also establish 
various values and practices as socially expected or **normative** (e.g. in many Western consumer societies it is **normalised** that 
everyone should want to own a large expensive car rather than take public transport). 

Advertising can also have a profound influence on how we feel about ourselves (by associating certain 
brands with **social status**, **national pride** and other **identities**. 

### Digital strategies

In the one-to-many era, the news industry was able to monopolise people‚Äôs access to current information and so, historically, news 
organisations found it relatively easy to gain and hold the public‚Äôs attention. As a result, the industry was spectacularly profitable. 
Over the past few decades though, this model has declined in the face of the challenges of many-to-many publishing. 

A growing share of people‚Äôs attention goes to websites and apps and so advertising revenue increasingly goes to two **online advertisers** 
(Google/Alphabet and Meta/Facebook/Instagram), who collect, or **aggregate** content such as an index of websites or people‚Äôs social media posts. As a result, they also
 have access to much of the data about what people do online. 
 
This shift in attention has challenged the revenue stream of the news industry in particular and is causing major changes to employment practices and the business 
of news, including in South Africa, where many publications have been closed and newsrooms have retrenched staff ([Dugmore, 2018](/ideas/references/index.html#dugmore_2018)). 

### Influencers

For a long time, brands have routinely recruited famous celebrities to attract attention to their products 
and campaigns, and to associate the brand with the qualities that people admire about the celebrity. 

Increasingly, brands also use  **influencers** (also known as **content creators**) to target messages and content to smaller groups (niches) of people. 

In 2025 it was estimated that the global value of influencer marketing would be $33 billion (USD) ([Statista Research Team, 2025](/ideas/references/index.html#statista_2025)).

Influencers are popular social media users who are able to attract the attention of a number of other users (known as their followers) who come to feel that they 
know the influencer personally and hence tend to trust their judgement, including their product recommendations ([Stokel-Walker, C. 2021](/ideas/references/index.html#stokel-walker_2021)).

What strategies does this influencer post use to gain attention? What audience do you think Volkswagen were targeting and why?


While celebrities have large followings or "reach" and can gain the attention of large numbers of people, a recent 
[study](https://modernmarketing.co.za/nano-influencers-lead-in-engagement-according-to-sa-influencer-report/)
in SA suggests that so-called "nano-influencers" are more successful at driving engagement by interacting in a more relatable way 
with their followers.

Increasingly, influencers are represented by **influencer marketing companies**, which themselves are
being acquired by the holding companies for **advertising agencies**, such as Publicis and WPP ([Siu, 2025](/ideas/references/siu_2025).


### Influence industry

Global brands and corporations have historically relied on spending large amounts of money on public 
relations to attract the attention of the media, and on advertising and advertorial to influence how stories are told to the public. 

This **influence industry** extends beyond marketing to the world of politics, international relations and even warfare. In this murky 
area of contemporary politics, computational **propagandists** use social media to target ads to specific groups of voters in campaigns
intended to drum up support for particular political candidates and harass their opponents ([Woolley, 2023](/ideas/references/index.html#woolley_2023)).

Their techniques include manipulating [algorithms](/ideas/2_data/) to make sure that their carefully designed persuasion and deceptive content will 
feature on lists of ‚Äútrending‚Äù topics. They also pay influencers in carefully chosen niches to artificially boost their  content and
make it appear that they have a groundswell of popular support (Woolley, 2023).

Gaining attention in this environment is not easy for everyone who wants to build an audience or mobilise supporters. The budgets of 
such commercial players and bad faith propagandists far exceed those of ordinary people. 

### Interest and attention

While the media‚Äôs demand for our attention is real, humans have many ways to respond. Throughout history, in different societies, 
people have developed practices to control their ability to concentrate, to hone their attention, and to focus and defocus. Such 
practices include the use of breathing, and meditation. As a result of the contemporary onslaught on our attention, many people‚Äôs daily 
media practices now include ways to limit or focus attention. We carefully select which accounts we follow or which apps we install, 
limit the time we spend on social media,  or even completely delete our accounts and switch our phones off. 

In response to the proliferation of media and the number of questionable sources attempting to manipulate our attention, our media 
practices have also shifted to emphasise greater **media literacy**, and the use of fact-checking sites, advanced **verification** 
practices and activist campaigns against misleading and hate-fuelled sources. 

This brings us back to **social semiotics** where scholars have highlighted the **active** way in which human beings **[make meaning](/ideas/1_meaning/)**
from media. We are selective with our attention, when we encounter a **semiotic resource**
we draw on our own prior experiences and what we've learned from communities we belong to, and "frame" it contextually and in accord with our own interests, 
and we always produce our own inner representation of its meaning:

>"interest shapes attention which produces engagement, leading to selection of elements from the message, 
leading to a framing of these elements, which leads to their transformation and transduction, which produces a 
new ("inner") sign" ([Kress, 2009:42](/ideas/references/index.html#kress_2009))
