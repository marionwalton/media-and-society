## Talking about gender

Since much of the language we use to talk about gender is shaped by the patriarchal and colonial history of the English language, we’ll need to define a **vocabulary** that will help us express how media images play a powerful role in influencing, communicating and changing our identities and beliefs about **sex**, **gender** and **sexuality**.

## Sex and/or gender?

​​Feminists have traditionally distinguished between the terms “sex” (used to discuss biological issues) and “gender” (referring to culture and signification). For example, Oakley ([1972:6](references.html#oakley_1972)) explains the difference as follows:

"Sex" is a word that refers to the biological differences between male and female: the visible difference in genitalia, the related difference in procreative function. “Gender” however is a matter of culture: it refers to the social classification into “masculine” and “feminine”.

Nonetheless, many feminists would argue that our understanding of biological sex is also profoundly shaped by cultural beliefs about gender. Butler ([1999](references.html#butler_1999)) argues that it makes no sense to talk about biological “sex” separate from its social meanings as part of their critique of questions essentialist uses of the category "woman". 

Women scientists in particular have highlighted how sexist ideologies have distorted scientists’ perception of sex, reproduction and female animals ([Cooke, 2022:x](references.html#cooke_2022)). Despite claims that “male” and "female” sexes are neatly differentiated, contemporary biological sciences suggest a far more complex picture. There is extensive biological variation in many physical traits, and even the chromosomes associated with “male” and “female” development involve complex activations and downstream effects ([Graves, 2018](references.html#graves_2018)) . 

To add to this complexity, bio-medical technologies such as birth control pills, hormone replacement therapy, gender affirming therapies and even body-altering fashions such as cosmetic surgery and corsets are cultural interventions mediating our physical experience and gender presentation. 

In this course we prefer the term gender, since Media Studies focuses on issues of culture and signification, and discussions of gender rather than biology. 

## Biological traits and the media

Our experience of living in a human body is mediated culturally through the language and images we use to represent and describe our bodies. While bodies exhibit a wide range of many different variations, language works in simplistic categories (man/woman), and visual media tends to reinscribe these categorical differences. 

{: .example}
For example, while men are more likely to be biologically taller than women, there are some women who are taller than many or even most men. In Hollywood, many women actors are taller than their (male) love interests. These tall women actors tend to be shot in ways which exaggerate the height of the man in relation to the woman. In this and many other ways media industries tend to exaggerate physical gender differences as a part of reinscribing **heteronormativity**.

Beyond exaggerating gender differences, the media can be used to build public understanding of physical diversity. Instead it often amplifies the stigma and harmful vitriol directed at anyone who does not conform to a rigid binary. Think of how the international news media stigmatised Caster Semenya. Although Semenya identifies and was raised as a woman, her testosterone levels were ruled too high for her to compete in women’s categories without medical intervention.

### Queer theory and post-structuralism
A **post-structuralist** approach to gender known as **queer theory** builds on and critiques the **structuralist** ideas we encountered when we studied **semiotics**. According to De Saussure (a structuralist), language is **a system of differences** where signifiers gain meaning in relation to other signifiers. From this perspective, the relationship between the signifier “woman” and what it signifies is conventional and "arbitrary". From this perspective, to understand the meaning of this signifier we need to understand how the word "woman" differs from other signifiers (e.g. “man”). 

Post-structuralists point out that such relationships between signifiers are not fixed but **shift and change**.  In particular, signification changes over time, as illustrated in Figure 1. 

 [Foucault (1980:132)](references.html#foucault_1980) argues that what counts as “truth” is mostly governed (though not exclusively so) by socially dominant institutions. For example, while same-sex sexual practices have existed throughout history, Foucault details how the category "homosexual" only came into being in the 19th century when the medical institutions and practices of the time started documenting a phenomenon they were starting to label as "homosexuality".  

Post-structuralist ideas have also been influential in media studies which investigate how gender normativities are reinforced and challenged through **performative** signifying practices. From the perspective of queer theory, gendered discourse & performativity are “regulatory practices within which bodily contours are constructed" [(Butler, 1999:181)(references.html#butler_1999)]. In other words, powerful social institutions make many of the rules and regulatory practices by which we learn to "do" gender in our bodies, and they also police our bodies when we don't conform. As the idea of non-conformity suggests, we can also counter this power, since our bodies are signs that we can control, vary, and change.

### Queer
{: .definition}
The term “queer” is a reclaimed homophobic insult, which now encompasses a wide range of identities. Queer identities refuse heterosexuality as the standard for all sexualities. 

Queer is also used as a verb. Rather than “queer” describing something people are, from this perspective “queer” is something that people do (especially by parodying gender and calling into question gendered identities) ([
Barker, 2016](references.html#barker_2016)).

### Queer theory
{: .definition}
Queer theory is used to challenge essentialism, break down oversimplifying **binaries**, and to question **heteronormative** identities, categories, and assumptions through the argument that gender norms are performative signifying practices.

By showing how sexuality may be shaped by race and gender in many ways, queer theory exposes how sexual and gender identities are socially constructed. (For more see Baker).

### Gender performativity
{: .definition}
The idea of gender performativity rests on the concept that we learn to “do” gender every day by imitating examples around us, and that gendered discourse is performative in that it works to create and define gender categories. 

	“Gender is a kind of imitation for which there is no original” (Butler, 1999, 722). 

In this way we can think of our bodies as a signifying practice or medium as well as an embodied biological existence. The way we “do” gender can change, but other people will still be reading our identities within the current system. 

By gender performativity, Butler does not mean that gender is something that can be simply "put on" as an actor might put on a wig or hat. Gender is a performance but performativity also works like performatives in language (e.g. "I pronounce you man and wife"), in other words, naming someone a girl or boy works to create them as such ([Szorenyi, 2022](references.html#szorenyi_2022)).

 through the process of repeatedly observing and using particular gendered words, actions, and attitudes, we are constructed as gendered human beings. (For more see Baker)

### Embodied signifying practices

Can we think of our bodies as a medium? **Gender performativity** is one way of explaining how, on the one hand, signs construct and police bodies, and, on the other, how our bodies are also signs that we can control, vary, and challenge. Our **embodied signifying practices** include gendered discourse about bodies & **gender performativity**. In other words, our signifying practices create legible bodies: “a social space for and of the body within certain regulatory grids of intelligibility” ([Butler, 1999:178](references.html#butler_1999)). 


### Sexism  
{: .definition}
Sexism is the ideology justifying men’s dominance in patriarchal social structures.

### Patriarchal social structures 
{: .definition}
Social systems where most women are dominated by some men, where gender oppression **intersects** with other systems of oppression (race, class, sexuality, disability, age etc). 

We often talk about “patriarchy” in a simplistic way as a single system of male domination, or as if “the patriarchy” is a ruling body of powerful individuals. 

Feminist philosopher Kate Manne ([2017](references.html#manne_2017)) explains that, in patriarchal social structures, most women are dominated by some men and that patriarchal structures also **[intersect](definitions.html#intersectionality)** with other systems of oppression (race, class, sexuality, disability, age etc). Patriarchal social structures are also influenced by structures which promote equality (universal suffrage, free childcare, affirmative action etc.). 

Manne argues that these patriarchal social structures do not only lead to gendered hierarchies of domination but also to men’s expectations and sense of entitlement that they will be positioned as dominant with respect to some woman or women. Consequently, Manne claims, even in situations of nominal equality, men tend to have **entitlements** and women tend to have **obligations**. 

### Intersectionality

{:.definition}
The idea that people experience discrimination differently based on their overlapping identities.

Legal scholar Kimberle Crenshaw coined the term “intersectionality” when she saw how affirmative action policies  in the United States assisted white women, or African American men, but were not helpful to African American women, who experienced an intersection of oppression as a result of not just their gender or their race, but their race together with their gender ([Crenshaw, 1991](references.html#crenshaw_1991)).

Humans never exist as only a gender, we always have other intersectional identities. Think about how race, language, age, class, and religion all  change the way others perceive our gender identity.

### Misogyny 

{: .definition}
Misogyny enforces patriarchal social structures by punishing women (in particular) when they deviate from sexist norms ([Manne, 2017](references.html#manne)). 

Misogyny as policing can often be seen in the language we use to describe people. For example, in languages such as English, certain derogatory words are used to construct and simultaneously stigmatise gendered identities, e.g. “bitch” (when a woman is disliked in any way, often because she does not conform to some gendered obligation) or "slut", when she is sexually active. 

In the case of slurs for men, such as “sissy” or “pussy” (when a man is not seen to be suitably masculine) men’s perceived inadequacies in masculinity are punished by the use of feminising slurs or labels. In this way, homophobia and misogyny are often linked.

### Misogynoir  
{: .definition}
Misogynoir is a term for racism combined with misogyny directed towards Black women in particular. 

### Cisgender  
{: .definition}
Cisgender is a term for individuals whose gender identity generally matches with their assigned sex, and who express a normative gender identity outwardly in terms of clothing, hair, and tone of voice.

### Cis normativity
{: .definition}
Cis normativity refers to the assumption that everyone identifies as the gender they were assigned at birth. 

Cis normativity ignores and stigmatises transgender people, who do not identify with the gender they were originally assigned, or who do not identify with only one gender .
