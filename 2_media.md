When we talk loosely about media, we tend to bundle several senses of the word together - (1) media of production and distribution (2) a medium or mode of communication and (3) media industries or organisations.

### Media of production, distribution and reception 
We use a wide range of physical media to produce, distribute or convey messages to one another. 

As in the case of the <a href="1_media.html" id="iziko_rhino">Iziko rhino engraving</a>  humans have used durable materials such as rock to communicate with one another throughout history. Other examples of everyday media used to create and distribute messages include soundwaves, fabrics and paint. 

Electronic and print media get more complex and involve reception technologies which extend the range of human senses such as sight and hearing. For example, a radio programme might be produced digitally, distributed over the air via  radio waves and received on a transistor radio, which generates the sound waves heard by the listener.  
  
Popular social media apps such as TikTok are designed for mobile phones. In such cases, both app and phone are  media of production and reception, and they require TikTok's data centres and algorithms, mobile internet or wifi to distribute media from creators to viewers.

### Mode of communication 
The phrase "medium of communication" is often used to refer to **human languages** such as isiXhosa, Afrikaans, and English. We tend to use the word "mode" when we refer to other modes of communication, such as **visuals or music**.

We learn to use languages to make and share meaningful messages with others who have a shared understanding of the linguistic "code" we are using. These symbolic systems go beyond language and also include the **visual and other modes** of communication which humans use to make meaning, such as images, clothing, gestures, expressions or music.

In the case of the [Iziko Rhino example](1_media.html#example---iziko-rhino), the **visual meaning** of the image has many dimensions. 
Some of these dimensions of meaning are are based on the visual resemblance between a rhino and the engraving. For this reason, we can still recognise the shape of the rhino
if we have encountered rhinos or images of rhinos today. 

Other dimensions of the engraving's meaning are based on the cultural and spiritual significance of the image. Today its significance, 
 when viewed in a museum or on a website would be very different to seeing it in its original context (when it possibly formed part 
of a San spiritual ritual). Thus some dimensions of meaning depend heavily on the context in which the message or image is created or encountered.

### Media industries and organisations
Often when we talk about "the media" we are referring to the **for-profit media industries**
which have developed around complex media production and distribution networks such as **television broadcasting, news publishers and networks, advertising
and public relations agencies, or social media platforms**. [Mass media](definitions.html#mass-media) are generally produced by commercial media industries. In contemporary society, such organisations are primarily motivated to make a **profit**. 

In the case of the Iziko Rhino, the image is published on the Wikimedia Commons, which is funded by a **non-profit** foundation, and is thus an example of non-commercial media.

To access Wikimedia we rely on several for-profit industries which produce computers or cellphones or which provide web hosting, electricity and internet access.
