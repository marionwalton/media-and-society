# Types of "media"

When we talk loosely about media, we tend to bundle several senses of the word together - (1) media of production and distribution (2) medium of communication (mode) and (3) media industries or organisations.

### Media of production, distribution and reception 
We use a wide range of media to produce, distribute or convey messages to one another. We tend to think of electronic or print media first,  but, as in the case of the rhino engraving in Figure 1, humans have used durable materials such as rock to communicate with one another throughout history. Other examples of everyday media used to create and distribute messages include soundwaves, fabrics and paint. 
  
Popular social media apps such as TikTok are both media of production and reception.

### Mode of communication 
The phrase "medium of communication" is often used to refer to **human languages** such as isiXhosa, Afrikaans, and English. We tend to use the word "mode" when we refer to other modes of communication, such as **visuals or music**.

We learn to use languages to make and share meaningful messages with others who have a shared understanding of the linguistic "code". These symbolic systems go beyond language and also include the **visual and other modes** of communication which humans use to make meaning, such as images, clothing, gestures, expressions or music.

In the case of the Iziko Rhino, the **visual meaning** of the image has many dimensions. 
Some of these dimensions of meaning are based on resemblance. For this reason, we can still recognise the shape of the rhino
if we have encountered rhinos or images of rhinos today. 
Other dimensions of the engraving's meaning are based on the cultural and spiritual significance of the image. Today its significance, 
 when viewed in a museum or on a website would be very different to seeing it in its original context (when it possibly formed part 
of a San spiritual ritual). Thus some dimensions of meaning depend heavily on the context in which the message or image is created or encountered.

### Media industries and organisations
Often when we talk about "the media" we are referring to the **for-profit media industries**
which have developed around complex media production and distribution networks such as **television broadcasting, news publishers and networks, advertising
and public relations agencies, or social media platforms**.

Media industries tend to be associated with large commercial media organisations which aim to target large audiences
of people, and are thus known as [mass media](definitions.html#mass-media). These are businesses which exist to create and sell media products such as news, advertising, entertainment, or data which can be used to target advertising. 

In contemporary society, such organisations are usually primarily motivated to make a **profit**, which means they depend on selling subscriptions and advertising. 

In the case of the Iziko Rhino, the image is published on the Wikimedia Commons, which is funded by a **non-profit** foundation, and is thus an example of non-commercial media.

Nonetheless, to access Wikimedia we rely on several for-profit industries which produce computers or cellphones or which provide web hosting, electricity and internet access.
