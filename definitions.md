## Definitions
{: .no_toc }

You should generally avoid using regular dictionaries to find the meaning of *academic keywords*. 
Academic keywords have specialised meanings based in a particular area of study, and so their definition
may be quite different to how the word is used in everyday language. 
_Your readings have been carefully chosen to provide important definitions and explanations that you'll need in this course_.
In cases where there the definitions aren't included in your readings, you should find them below.

{:toc}

### Affordance
An affordance of a mode of communication is what it is possible to express and represent or communicate easily with 
the resources of a mode, and what is less straightforward or even impossible. Thus all modes of communication
have potential and constraints. 

### Algorithm
An algorithm is a  set of rules that are followed in calculations and other problems. Contemporary cameras and 
apps such as Instagram and TikTok include graphical algorithms ("filters") which can create certain visual effects ("beautifying", blurring etc).
On social media platforms common algorithms include **editorial tasks** such as sorting, recommendations, content moderation and so on. 
Generative AI systems are also algorithms, so that for example LLMs are essentially deep learning algorithms
that perform a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
The algorithms of Generative AI systems can also be set up to avoid producing certain kinds of content present in the training data or responding to 
certain types of prompts, which can be seen as a new form of **content moderation** or **censorship**. 

### Analogue media 
Analogue media store analogue signals (such as the physical texture on a vinyl record), transmit them in the form of electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves, or play them back as analogue audio.

### Artificial Intelligence or AI  

Artificial intelligence is an academic field with a 60 year history but the term does not have a generally 
accepted definition. The term “artificial intelligence” is more often used by marketers than researchers, and broadly refers to machines “acting like humans”, or passing the Turing test, where a human would not be able to distinguish a machine from a human in conversation (Verdegem, 2021:4). Apart from its scientific meanings, the term “artificial intelligence” is also currently used by the tech industry as part of a wave of marketing hype intended to sell a range of software products which often promise to reduce costs or increase speed by automating various human tasks. More precisely, AI refers to 
the ways in which we use machine learning, neural networks and various statistical models to automate certain tasks.

## AGI or Artificial General Intelligence 
This idea of a godlike (or malevolent) superintelligence lies somewhere between science fiction and fantasy. 

## Binary oppositions
 Binary oppositions are a system of opposing and mutually exclusive categories or signifiers (“man” vs “woman”, “she” vs “he”,“straight” vs “gay”, “logical” vs “emotional”) which underpin **hegemonic** social hierarchies.
 
## Chatbot
Contemporary Generative AI systems are connected to a chatbot interface, which allows users to ask questions via text or speech interfaces and then uses 
statistical models to predict and synthesize a likely "answer" to the user's prompt. By simulating "typing" and "thinking", the interface often encourages
users to humanise or **anthropomorphise** the system (as do terms such as "intelligence" and "training") 
as a when it is really simply a new form of **automation**.

## Cisgender  
Cisgender is a term for individuals whose gender identity generally matches with their assigned sex, and who express a normative gender identity outwardly in terms of clothing, hair, and tone of voice.

## Cis normativity
Cis normativity refers to the assumption that everyone identifies as the gender they were assigned at birth. 

## Citation
A citation supports the claims you're making in academic writing, gives credit to another author, helps the reader to find the source you've used, shows the amount of research you've done, and is the only way to avoid [plagiarism](definitions.html#plagiarism) in academic writing. For an academic essay in this course, which uses the UCT Author-Date style of referencing, a citation consists of providing an _in-text citation_ in the text of your essay and a _full reference_ to the source you've referred to at the end of the essay in a [list of references](definitions.html#reference).  An _in-text citation_ helps the reader find the full reference and also points to the specific point in the source you're referring to. It includes the author's surname, the date of publication, and often the page number. 

## Counter-hegemony
A world view or activity that is in opposition to and challenges the dominant world view. (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## Cultural studies
Cultural Studies is an academic subject or area of study which is closely related to media studies. In cultural studies, "culture" is approached as an everyday activity, where people make sense of the world, relate to others, and participate in society in ever-changing and contextually nuanced ways. This goes beyond the common sense understanding of culture as artistic products such as paintings, books, music or films. In this course we study scholars who have contributed to this tradition including Antonio Gramsci, Stuart Hall, Raymond Williams, Adam Haupt and others.

## Cultural imperialism
The idea of cultural imperialism describes the unidirectional flow of media and cultural content in the context of a broadly Western hegemony over the rest of the world. Because of the historical power of the USA, this approach often focused on how the USA has dominated cultural industries globally, with its programming, advertising and consumer culture influencing that of the rest of the world.

## Definition
Academic terms have specific meanings in particular fields of study. This means you can't use a regular dictionary to find out what they mean. Instead, consult your readings. Using these definitions in your pocket textbook is a good start. Also look out for definitions when reading articles by important scholars in the field. Make sure you always cite the **actual source you used** when providing a definition.

## Diffusion model 
A model which has been trained on a large collection of images that are “diffused” into and out of random noise. 
This “teaches” the model to see images in noise and generate them from scratch. Almost every major image-generating 
AI model on the market today is a diffusion model. Examples of such AI systems include Midjourney, DALL-E (ChatGPT’s 
image generator), Stable Diffusion and Imagen.

## Digital inequality
Digital inequality (also known as the digital divide) refers to the differences in use of digital technology and services by 
different groups of people. People's socio-economic status, age, gender and race can all mean that they have fewer opportunities 
to benefit from and enjoy using digital media.

## Digital media
Digital media are created using signals expressed as a series of the numbers (digits) 0 and 1. This means that they can be processed by a computer.

## Discourse (Foucault)
A range of ways of thinking which organise and transmit social control, thus maintaining social power. (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## Discourse 
Modes of thought, speech, or expression, collective discussion or interplay of meanings and ideas circulating around a particular subject. (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## Discourse analysis
A technique for studying how power and knowledge are communicated through texts, language use, and systems of thought.d.Modes of thought, speech, or expression, collective discussion or interplay of meanings and ideas circulating around a particular subject. (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## Dominant ideology (Althusser)
A world view that supports the ruling class as dominant, the status quo, shared by the majority of people. (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## Dominant discourse
Contemporary ideas and beliefs shared by a majority of people. (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## Emergent discourse
New ideas and beliefs held by a few people at first, gradually becoming accepted by more people. (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## Generative AI
Generative AI, or GenAI refer to generative models such as LLMs or diffusion models. Used as media production tools, these are leading to dramatic shifts in both professional and everyday media practices. Four tech companies, namely Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Microsoft and Meta (Facebook) have recently 
invested billions of dollars in their respective Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems which will have major consequences for the media production ecosystem. GenAI AIGC (Artificial Intelligence generated content) is already being incorporated in a wide range of image editing and graphic design software (e.g. Adobe, Canva) as well as short form video production apps for social platforms (e.g. Douyin/TikTok). The use of generative models to produce media raises various ethical issues and is facing several legal challenges.

## Gender
Gender refers to “social and cultural roles, personality traits, and behaviours that are deemed socially acceptable for men and women in relation to concepts of masculinity and femininity” ([O’Shaughnessy,  Stadler, & Casey, 2016:360](references.html#oshaughnessy_2016)). 

## Gender performativity
The idea of gender performativity rests on the concept that we learn to “do” gender every day by imitating examples around us, and that gendered discourse is performative in that it works to create and define gender categories. 

## Hegemony 
Hegemony, in the Gramscian tradition, can be defined as "Power and leadership maintained through processes of struggle and negotiation, especially through winning the consent of the majority to accept the ideologies of the dominant group as common sense". (O'Shaugnessy, Stadler & Casey, 2016)

## Incorporation
Process by which ideas and movements considered dangerous or radical are made acceptable. (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## Interpellation
A process in which we internalise ideologies as a response to being hailed or addressed. (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## Intersectionality
Intersectionality refers to the way social categorisations and hierarchies such as gender, race, class, age, ability, sexuality are interconnected, and create unique experiences of disadvantage where they intersect. Intersectional feminists have highlighted how humans never exist as only a gender, we always have other intersectional identities. 

## Identity
The way we understand who we are. (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## Ideology
Sets of social values, ideas, beliefs, feelings, and representations by which people collectively make sense of the world (a world view). (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## LM or Language Model 
Language Models (LM) are trained on text, and tend to be specialised. 

## LLM or Large Language Model 
Large Language Models include OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini (previously Bard) and Meta’s Llama. LLMs are able to generate lengthy plausible sounding text answers and simulate convincing conversations fluently. 

## Machine Learning 
Most contemporary uses of the term AI actually refer to Machine Learning.  Machine Learning is a subfield of AI which identifies patterns in data in order to use them for prediction. The word “learning” is used to refer to the way these systems can produce outputs which have not been explicitly programmed. Learning algorithms can be supervised or unsupervised. Supervised algorithms learn by example. Unsupervised learning algorithms classify data into groups of similar items.

The term “learning” in machine learning is another example of anthropomorphism. The processes of Machine Learning are very different to how biological learning takes place. The way neural network models are constructed from the patterns in training data is not the same as the way animal brains form new connections whenever they learn something new. 

## Media
Media include the physical media, languages and industries which transmit and encode the messages we use to communicate with one another.

## Mass media
Mass media are the *communication industries* which produce *information and entertainment products* and court the attention of *large audiences*, which they often sell to *advertisers*. These include broadcasters, networks,streaming sites, print and digital publishers and a range of other corporate media producers. This is usually what we mean when we talk about “the media”.

## Mode
Modes of communication are symbolic systems which include language as well as **visual and other modes** of communication which humans use to make meaning, such as sound, images, clothing, gestures, expressions or music.

## Mode of Address
The way a text speaks to or addresses its audience. (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## Multimodality
Multimodality involves the use of more than one semiotic mode in meaning-making, including but not limited to written and spoken language, images, and music.

## Media practices
Media practices are the activities, habits and routines where people use media (individually or together) as part of a socially meaningful activity.

## Misogyny 
Misogyny enforces patriarchal social structures by punishing women (in particular) when they deviate from sexist norms ([Manne, 2017](references.html#manne)). 

## Misogynoir  
Misogynoir is a term for racism combined with misogyny directed towards Black women in particular. 

## Network
A network can be defined as any system of relationships ([Chandler & Munday,2020a](/ideas/references/index.html#chandler_munday_2020a))
which may represent relationships between people and things, or between words and other semiotic resources.

## Neural Networks  
A neural network is a statistical data structure based on early ideas about how the human brain works with trillions of interconnected cells or neurons. The artificial neural network is constructed or “trained” by being fed large  amounts of data (such as images from a museum gallery website, wikipedia articles, or chat logs). The network identifies patterns in the data (such as characteristic uses of colour by a particular artist) and processes them to build a mathematical model of an interconnected set of billions or trillions of parameters (numbers). Each numerical parameter is called a “neuron”, by analogy to the cellular structures in animal brains. The patterns in multidimensional sequences (vectors) of these neurons are used to synthesise media. 

## Normativity
The imposition of norms and standards regarding how people ought to behave and  value.

### Objectification
Objectification is the act of treating or viewing a person  and especially a woman, _as an object_. In many cases this refers to sexual objectification, where women are reduced to their bodies or appearance, are identified with their body, or parts of their body.  

## Oramedia 
Oramedia includes traditionally *oral forms* such as storytelling, proverbs, folklore, folktales, drama, puppetry and oral poetry. Digital media are also used to extend the reach of these indigenous forms of communication. 

## Open Access
Open access means anyone should be able to access a resource. There are no financial, legal or technical barriers to accessing it for various purposes. Open access works use **Creative Commons** licenses which mean that the authors are always acknowledged and various uses of the resource are allowed e.g. copying or creating derivative works.

## Oppositional Gaze
The oppositional gaze refers to a space of viewer resistance and a critical perspective on mass media's lack of meaningful Black representation (bell hooks)

## Patriarchal social structures 

Social systems where most women are dominated by some men, where gender oppression **intersects** with other systems of oppression (race, class, sexuality, disability, age etc). 

## Post-structuralist
Post-structuralism is a philosophical approach to discourse and representation, which argues that language is not directly connected to a “reality” outside of language and which challenges binary oppositions (man/woman,rational/emotional). Post-structuralism approaches language as a set of inter-related and shifting significations, which derive their meaning from the fluid and changing relationships shaping social reality. 

## Postfeminism
Postfeminism emerged as a response to second wave feminism, when advances in women's equality shifted the focus to individual choice, empowerment (especially through consumption), sexual agency and away from collective political action. 

## Public
Traditionally scholars have talked about "the public", which includes all members of a community such as a nation, city or region, and their legal and political institutions of government.
In media studies it is also common to talk about "publics", which acknowledges that people often have a sense of living, working and communicating together in groups which may be smaller, such as 
a family group chat, or very large, such as a global audience for big media events.

## Provenance
Provenance aims for more transparency regarding the origins and operations of Generative AI.
It responds to the need to know where media and ideas come from, not only to avoid plagiarism, but 
also to be aware of their different contexts of use. Academic referencing is one system of
establishing provenance. Provenance goes beyond the basic information usually included in citations 
(author, date, publisher etc), but also identifies where a media text has "travelled", 
and how it is used in these contexts. This is particularly important for synthetic media and Generative AI, since LLMs often don't reveal these details at all. 

## Queer
The term “queer” is a reclaimed homophobic insult, which now encompasses a wide range of identities. Queer identities refuse heterosexuality as the standard for all sexualities. ([Barker, 2016](references.html#barker_2016))

## Queer theory
Queer theory is used to challenge essentialism, break down oversimplifying **binaries**, and to question **heteronormative** identities, categories, and assumptions through the argument that gender norms are performative signifying practices.

By showing how sexuality may be shaped by race and gender in many ways, queer theory exposes how sexual and gender identities are socially constructed. ([Barker, 2016](references.html#barker_2016))

## Reference
A full reference is included in the [list of references](definitions.html#reference) at the end of an assignment. A reference provides all the information the reader would need to find and check a source you've referred to. A full reference also includes the author's name and the date of publication, as well as (depending on the kind of source you're citing), the publisher, place of publication and page numbers or URL of the material you're referencing.  The in-text citation appears when you use the source in the text of the essay and in the list of references at the end of the essay.

## Residual discourses
Sets of ideas and beliefs from the past that are still accepted by some. (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## Semiotic resources
Semiotic resources are the actions, knowledge and objects which we use for communicative purposes when making meaning (semiosis). These include all the physical resources and cultural practices used by humans as sign makers. For example, a singer is a sign-maker who makes meaning using their voice, knowledge of a musical genre and a spoken language, as well as recording technologies and sharing music via a social platform such as TikTok. 

## Sexism  

Sexism is the ideology justifying men’s dominance in patriarchal social structures.

## Stereotype
A stereotype is a belief, fixed image or set of characteristics used to represent or generalize about a particular type of person. Stereotypes can be positive as well as negative.

## Subjectivity
An individual's personal thoughts and experiences, their own way of seeing the world. The position from which we look at and understand the world. (O'Shaugnessy & Stadler)

## Social movement
A social movement occurs when members of a particular society share grievances such as the experience of oppression, and are motivated to change their society through effective group action. 
Social movements need to recruit others and communicate about their experiences, and they differ depending on the social context and the goals of the movement, which may be revolutionary or reformist, religious or secular and use tactics which are peaceful or violent.

## Social media 
Social media *platforms* bring together *users, content creators and advertisers,* in many cases on a social media site or app. Platforms represent their users' identities, content, relationships, attention and activities in the form of data, which they store, process and trade. Platforms have different functions, but many provide tools and 
functionality for sharing media (text, photos, and videos) with family or friends or for entertainment or professional purposes.

## Synthetic media 
Synthetic media refers to media which has been created or modified by algorithmic (computational) means, 
especially through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) such as Large Language Models (LLMs) 
(e.g. OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini). Synthetic media are also known as AI-generated
media, generative media, personalised media or (considerably less positively!) as "**AI sludge**"

## Social semiotics
Social semiotics is an academic subject or area of study which focuses on meaning making and how people go about making meaning. Social semitics is interested in how people represent their understanding of the world using different media (to disseminate messages) and how they develop semiotic resources or modes of representation (such as images, sound, and written language). Social semiotics also explores how people use media and semiotic resources to shape power relations with others. Scholars who have worked to develop this tradition include Michael Halliday, Gunther Kress, Robert Hodge, Theo van Leeuwen, and Carey Jewitt. 

## Training data 
This is the labelled or unlabelled data that is used to create an AI model’s artificial neural network.
A Generative AI model is developed from a very large collection of text and code (the "training data").
The data used to "train" or encode the model is usually billions of words or images "scraped" or copied from the internet and other sources (often without consent of the original author or artist). 
The scraped training data thus includes a great deal of marketing material, incorrect information (**misinformation**), deliberately misleading information (**disinformation**) and generally reflects the overall **biases** we tend to find on the Internet and social media sites. Unfortunately the raw web data used to train commercial models is loaded with racism, sexism and misinformation, and systems trained on such sources may simply reproduce and often exacerbate such biases.
