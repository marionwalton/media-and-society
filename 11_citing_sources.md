# Citing Sources & Referencing
{: .no_toc }

 [Citations](definitions.html/#citation) tell your reader that certain information and ideas you are using came from another source. A citation appears in the text you are writing (in-text citation) and is linked to a full [reference](definitions.html#reference).

## Why use citations?
 
 In academic writing you need to identify the source of almost everything that you write. Today, an academic text without citations carries very little weight and can be assumed to be generated by ChatGPT or another [GenerativeAI](definitions.html#generative-ai).
 
 Together, an accurate in-text citation and a reference provide all the information the reader needs to find a source you referred to and identify the exact section of the source you're referring to. Then they can [verify](definitions.html#verification) your claims about it by reading the source themselves,  evaluating the claims you've made and perhaps they would then go on to explore the source further. 

 Citing your sources strengthens your work, supports your claims, shows your understanding of what you've read, gives credit to other authors, and is the only way to avoid [plagiarism](definitions.html#plagiarism).  

## What about AI citations?
 
 Citations generated by ChatGPT or another [GenerativeAI](definitions.html#generative-ai) indicate a probable rather than an actual association between a text and a source. Citations themselves are synthetic, which means the texts they reference haven't been checked and sometimes don't even exist. 

 Unfortunately when you're new to academic work you don't have the knowledge to evaluate GenAI citations and quotations. This can get you into serious trouble for [plagiarism](definitions.html#plagiarism).
 
 Although they may look superficially like academic writing, GenAI citations often don't check out in some way or another.  Synthetic citations are purely decorative as they don't reflect someone's process of research. They can't be relied on to reference actual sources or exact quotations. Since they are so often incorrect, they function to mislead the reader. This destroys trust in you, the author. 
 
 Instead of using GenAI to synthesize fake citations that don't correspond to actual sources, and which function to limit your own knowledge of a field you should aim to build up your citations slowly. Start as you complete course readings and conduct additional research. Whenever you read something, keep careful notes, complete with full references and page numbers. In this way you can make strong claims supported with accurate citations and build foundations of durable knowledge in your chosen area of expertise.

## What is a citation?

{: .definition}
A citation supports the claims you're making in academic writing, gives credit to another author, helps the reader to find the source you've used, shows the amount of research you've done, and is the only way to avoid [plagiarism](definitions.html#plagiarism) in academic writing. For an academic essay in this course, which uses the UCT Author-Date style of referencing, a citation consists of providing an _in-text citation_ in the text of your essay and a _full reference_ to the source you've referred to at the end of the essay in a [list of references](definitions.html#reference).  An _in-text citation_ helps the reader find the full reference and also points to the specific point in the source you're referring to. It includes the author's surname, the date of publication, and often the page number. 

## What about references?

{: .definition}
A full reference is included in the [list of references](definitions.html#reference) at the end of an assignment. A reference provides all the information the reader would need to find and check a source you've referred to. A full reference also includes the author's name and the date of publication, as well as (depending on the kind of source you're citing), the publisher, place of publication and page numbers or URL of the material you're referencing.  The in-text citation appears when you use the source in the text of the essay and in the list of references at the end of the essay.

## What is plagiarism?

{: .definition}
Plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty. If you haven't written something yourself you need to acknowledge the author by citing your source, [paraphrasing](definitions.html#paraphrase) any ideas you use and using an exact [quotation](definitions.html#quotation) to differentiate the author's words from your own. If you haven't read a source yourself, you should not cite it.
