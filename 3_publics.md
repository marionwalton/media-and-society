# Media, publics & power
{: .no_toc }

*By Marion Walton, University of Cape Town*


Media plays a central role in creating our sense of community, and the feeling of participating in a [**public**](/ideas/definitions/index.html#public). We may
experience this sense of being part of a public (rather than an audience) 
when engaging with others by participating in a protest, tuning into a talk radio show, watching short videos created by other 
fans of our favourite musicians, or following social media commentary while watching a TV show.

Media and communication are essential to the kind of active publics known as [**social movements**](/ideas/definitions/index.html#social_movements) ([Walder, 2009](/ideas/references/index.html#walder_2009)). 
Social movements often arise when people realise that some form of social oppression isn't
just an individual problem, but is something they share with many others: 

>"they are ready to transform their anger into action, as soon as they overcome their fear. 
And they overcome their fear by the extreme expression of anger, in the form of outrage, when learning 
of an unbearable event suffered from someone with whom they identify. This identification is better 
achieved by sharing feelings in some form of togetherness created in the process of communication."" ([Castells, 2015:15](/ideas/references/index.html#castells_2015)) 


When people pay attention to some injustice together, and communicate their emotions about it, 
this shared attention can inspire or persuade them to act
together **as a public** and to change an oppressive  society. We tend to think first of the social movements
that are associated with contemporary social media and hashtags such as #blacklivesmatter, #feesmustfall, #metoo or #aminext. 
Yet, historically, social movements have relied on whatever means of communication were available, including rumours, word of mouth, 
preachers' sermons, pamphlets, as well as the press ([Castells, 2015:15](/ideas/references/index.html#castells_2015)) 
 
If people can’t change their situation at a particular time, they also often find ways simply to get together
and **ridicule** or **parody** those in power ([Nyamnjoh, 2005](/ideas/references/index.html#nyamnjoh_2005)). Media also has a part in these subversive activities. 

### Publics and journalism

In liberal democracies, the media, and particularly investigative journalists, are expected to play an important 
role as political watchdogs, or the “fourth estate”. The term comes from the French revolution, where the 
judiciary, parliament and church were known as the first, second and third estates. The press (known as the fourth 
estate) commented on the activities of these other estates, and thus the term “fourth estate” emphasises the 
independence of a free press and the importance of informing the public and holding government power to account 
(for more about this see [O’Shaughnessy,  Stadler, & Casey, 2016: 17](/ideas/references/index.html#oshaughnessy_et_al_2016)).

Despite the suppression of free expression under colonialism and apartheid which we will discuss as we consider
[media and social power](/ideas/3_power/) there are many examples in South African history where media have in fact played this
role, such as where journalists, activists and whistleblowers brought racism, labour exploitation, government corruption and apartheid’s crimes 
against humanity to light. For example, during the apartheid era, Henry Nxumalo, (known as Mr Drum), worked for 
*Drum* magazine in the 1950s. Nxumalo often worked undercover, subjecting himself to the harsh conditions and 
abuse endured by prisoners and farm workers at the time and challenging the segregation of apartheid churches 
in his investigations ([Harber, 2018: 69-75](/ideas/references/index.html#harber_2018)). 

As you will learn in the section on **political economy**, in apartheid South Africa, the local corporate media
were founded to promote Afrikaner nationalism or else were owned by mining houses and catered to primarily 
white audiences (also see [Chuma, 2019](/ideas/references/index.html#chuma_2019)). While *Drum* magazine gave expression to political protest and defiance 
of black urban publics, the white press were generally silent about and even complicit with labour exploitation 
and publications were seldom prepared to flout the apartheid regime’s draconian censorship laws. Instead, lawyers, 
activists and  religious figures took on the role of “muckraking” or exposing stories which those in power 
preferred to suppress, sometimes doing so at great personal cost ([Harber, 2018](/ideas/references/index.html#harber_2018)). 

In another example, socialist and political journalist Ruth First authored political pamphlets and also exposed the 
exploitation of farmworkers in international leftist publications, such as *Fighting Talk* and the *Guardian* 
(she also edited the *Guardian*’s Johannesburg edition). First’s journalism and activism led to her being banned
from practising journalism and she was imprisoned and later murdered in exile by the South African Security Branch 
in Mozambique ([Harber, 2018:61-69](/ideas/references/index.html#harber_2018)), 

South Africa subsequently introduced laws to protect media freedom after the end of apartheid, and the media have
played an important role in the country’s democracy, particularly in breaking important stories about government
corruption, corporate malfeasance and state capture. Notably, whistleblowers and investigators from several news 
organisations, including amaBhungane, the *Daily Maverick*, *News24* and others worked together to tell stories 
based on an email leak, known as the Guptaleaks, which revealed massive money laundering of state funds, and the 
influence of the Gupta brothers on government ([Harber, 2018:260-267 and 326-335](/ideas/references/index.html#harber_2018)). This expose played an important 
part in the removal of former President Jacob Zuma. 

Even when countries such as South Africa guarantee freedom of expression, they still struggle with massive 
inequalities in the kinds of stories told and the voices which are heard in the media. Media practices are ingrained,
profit motives are powerful, and semiotic languages change slowly. For this reason,  it takes more than laws 
protecting free expression to ensure that important stories are told ([Wasserman, 2020](/ideas/references/index.html#wasserman_2020)). When people’s stories
*are* told, there’s no guarantee that anyone in a powerful position is listening. For example, even though indigenous 
language radio stations have the largest audiences in South Africa, English radio stations tend to be associated 
with the elite and the public sphere ([Bosch, 2022](/ideas/references/index.html#bosch_2022)). While everyone is theoretically free to speak, it is still 
extremely difficult for marginalised people to gain **public attention**.

Despite these limitations, one of the important roles of media is to help **bring people together** around a shared 
experience of a story or even to rally them around an imagined idea. In South African history, radio in indigenous 
languages was used to give voice to people’s perspectives and helped new publics emerge – in this case among people
who had not initially even been acknowledged before as a potential audience ([Gunner et al, 2011](/ideas/references/index.html#gunner_et_al_2011); [Nkoala, 2023](/ideas/references/index.html#nkoala_2023)). 

 Just as people can choose whether to pay attention to media or not, they can also decide which ideas they identify 
 with, and what kind of entertainment **sparks their imagination** and **motivates them to act**. As Nyamnjoh ([2011](/ideas/references/index.html#nyamnjoh_2011)) 
 asks, “how did the excluded succeed in making news about their experiences and sharing this news among themselves?”.
 For this reason, creating media can be a powerful way to bring about social change:  “The imagination is today a 
 staging ground for action, and not only for escape" ([Appadurai, 1996:7](/ideas/references/index.html#appadurai_1996)). 

### Public spheres and networked publics

Media studies has relied on the idea of a "**public sphere**" ([Habermas, 1989; 2006](/ideas/references/index.html#habermas_1989)), 
which depends on mass media providing a space for rational debate of important issues for a mass audience. 

The idea of a single "public sphere" has been contested and challenged because of the way in which such mediated deliberation tends to be dominated by social elites.
People excluded by the dominant elite have long 
developed alternative "**counterpublics**" or parallel communication 
spaces ([Fraser, 1990](/ideas/references/index.html#fraser_1990)). Furthermore, contemporary technologies lend themselves to multiple spaces and diverse publics, often driven 
by **affective** (emotional) dynamics ([Papacharissi, 2014](/ideas/references/index.html#papacharissi_2014); [Iyengar et al, 2012](/ideas/references/index.html#iyengar_et_al_2012)).

Social media spaces have become synonymous with the spread of mis-and disinformation as well as hate speech and propaganda. 
Popular ideas such as "**echo chambers**" and "**filter bubbles**" claim that 
social platforms and personalised search algorithms limit people's exposure to alternative ideas and that as a result of social media, we
are more likely to congregate around others with similar ideas ([Pariser, 2011](/ideas/references/index.html#pariser_2011)). 
In fact, social media users are in fact probably more likely to see a wider range of news sources than are people who don't use 
social media ([Fletcher & Nielsen, 2018](/ideas/references/index.html#fletcher_and_nielsen_2018))

Instead it's useful to think about "**personal publics**" ([Schmidt, 2011; 2014](/ideas/references/index.html#schmidt_2011)) and "**issue publics**" 
([Habermas, 2006:22](/ideas/references/index.html#habermas_2006)) as ways that people collectively share experiences, and 
debate and discuss the issues and interests that matter to them.

### Personal publics
Personal publics ([Schmidt, 2011; 2014](/ideas/references/index.html#schmidt_2011)) exist where people discuss issues with others they encounter often on various platforms, such as in a
WhatsApp group, or by commenting in Facebook or Instagram DMs . Such personal
publics can be powerful because people's personal relationships and their trust in people close to them can act
as powerful motivators for social change. Issues associated with the rise of personal publics 
involve "context collapse" or the breaches of privacy and confidence often seen in online spaces 
([Marwick & boyd, 2011](/ideas/references/index.html#marwick_boyd_2011)).

More profound breaches of privacy may be caused because messaging and social media data in the
form of government and corporate surveillance, as we discuss in the chapter about [data and surveillance](/ideas/2_data/). 
For this reason, more secure platforms (e.g. [Signal Messenger](https://signal.org/)) and analog 
communication channels are often preferred by activists.

### Issue publics
**Issue publics** take shape when networks of people "engage with each other around a shared issue or interest" ([Bruns, 2023:72]()), 
such as for example protests, devastating wildfires, an earthquake or other disaster, a big sporting or entertainment event, or a political 
controversy. 

We often associate issue publics with the **hashtags** which are used to help connect people to others who are discussing the topic, 
and which sometimes extend over a longer period of time to form an interest public which connects a community 
of people with a common interest (cf. [Bruns & Stieglitz, 2012](/ideas/references/index.html#bruns_stieglitz_2012); [Bruns 2023:74](/ideas/references/index.html#bruns_2023)))

### Social movements, issue publics and social media

As Tufekci ([2013](/ideas/references/index.html#tufekci_2013),[2017](/ideas/references/index.html#tufekci_2017)) points out, 
social media have also acted as "**pathways to public attention**" for 
social movements.

Think about the issue publics that have arisen to challenge police brutality in the U.S. since the killing of Michael Brown in 2014 and the global outrage when George Floyd was killed in 2020, forming the Black Lives
Matter movement ([Freelon et al., 2016]()). From a network perspective, we can see the power of influencers who connect their followers with ideas and causes 
([Abidin, 2018](); [Bruns, 2018]()).

Social movements need more than social media hashtags to move from initial waves of enthusiasm or anger of an issue public ("emotion-driven action")
to be able to consolidate an agenda for social change  ([Castells, 2015:16](/ideas/references/index.html#castells_2015)). 
Social change requires collective involvement and organisational work in long-term movement building 
and other activities that are required to develop alternative practices and modes of government.

Prominent voices and images in issue and interest publics are shaped both by people's passions and their prejudices, 
and the prominence of certain messages can certainly be manipulated by political actors and amplified by algorithms. 

Today, in South Africa, we still interact with media which encourages us to imagine ourselves in particular ways, 
often as consumers or as fans, but also as voters, creators or activists sharing stories and images which continue 
to involve us in conversation with one another. 

Later in the course we will explore how South African students used social
media and hashtags such as **\#rhodesmustfall \#feesmustfall** and **\#aminext** to mobilise huge protests as they 
demanded decolonised, accessible higher education, and an end to violence against women ([Bosch & Mutsvairo, 2017](ideas/references/index.html#bosch_mutsvairo_2017)). 

### Censorship

When people come together like this around a new idea it threatens the status quo, which is why governments and other
powerful actors in society often try to limit the ways in which people can use the media to share information. 
Historically the colonial powers and many subsequent governments and regimes in Africa have done so through direct 
**censorship, control and harassment** of journalists ([Nyamnjoh, 2005](/ideas/references/index.html#nyamnjoh_2005)). 

We still see these strategies being employed
to suppress content or people viewed as subversive, or to counter the power of marginalised publics when they try to
challenge the powerful and threaten their control of society ([Dunham, 2023](ideas/references/index.html#dunham_2023)).
Increasingly, however, with the wide range of media available, a common strategy is to rely less on direct censorship and instead **distract people’s 
attention and create confusion** about a topic (misinformation and disinformation, or “fake news”) ([Woolley, 2023](ideas/references/index.html#woolley_2023)). 

Similarly, on social platforms, the powerful companies and individuals which own platforms don’t always even need to delete or ban content that they find
questionable anymore, they can simply **limit the visibility** of certain posts which they consider controversial 
or offensive (sometimes called shadowbanning) ([Are & Paasonen, 2021](ideas/references/index.html#are_paasonen_2021)).

### Participation and representation

It is also important to recognise that **not everyone can participate equally** in public spaces. For example, some 
societies, including European colonial powers, traditionally associated men with the public arena of politics and 
work. Women have always worked and played important roles in their communities (especially working class and black 
women) but the dominant Western ideal of womanhood was one which relegated relatively privileged women to private 
spaces (the home and family) while exposing all women to the threat of violence, particularly when they ventured 
into public. This is reflected in the small fraction of news media which includes stories about women and women’s 
perspectives.  A recent report by the Global Media Monitoring Project estimated that it would take 67 years to 
close the average gender equality gap in news media ([Macharia, 2020](ideas/references/index.html#macharia_2020)). 

This is also apparent on social platforms. While women’s voices are heard more often on social media
than in mainstream media, the harassment of women politicians, celebrities, and journalists in particular is common. 
Many ordinary users who speak out on poorly moderated platforms like X/Twitter endure gendered and racial harassment 
([York, 2021](ideas/references/index.html#york_2021)).  

The power of accessing public attention is also why marginalised groups such as black people and women (black women
in particular) were historically excluded from media organisations, and particularly from playing leadership roles
in the media ([M\&G Data Desk, 2019](ideas/references/index.html#m_g_data_desk_2019))  These absences in turn have had effects on representation, as stories about
black people and women were simply not told, or were told in a way which perpetuated negative stereotypes. As the
**\#metoo movement** revealed, the power structures and hierarchies within these organisations allowed powerful men 
in particular to prey on women and on more vulnerable people within the media industries ([Erlingsdóttir & Chandra, 
2021](ideas/references/index.html#erlingsdottir_chandra_2021)).

Even today black people and women are likely to be **under-represented** at higher levels in media organisations. 
Post-apartheid history has also shown that, because of the profit motive of media industries under capitalism, 
whose attention is considered valuable in this economy, and the persistence of racialised discourse, changing the 
ownership and even the leadership of a media organisation does not necessarily change the nature of the stories 
that it most commonly produces ([Chuma, 2019](ideas/references/index.html#chuma_2019); [Govenden, 2022](ideas/references/index.html#govenden_2022)). 

This has all led to some massive failures of the media in our society. At the time of the Marikana massacre of 
striking miners, for example, journalists were standing behind the police line during the conflict and their 
camera footage reflected their perspective as “embedded” journalists, and failed to capture the highly militarized 
police gunning down fleeing miners. The audience saw the conflict almost “through the eyes of the police” ([De Waal, 
2012](ideas/references/index.html#de_waal_2012)), and it took a long time for a few researchers and reporters 
to piece together accounts from survivors and evidence at the scene of the killings. 


![“The Farlam Commission found that the police inappropriately chose to forcibly break the strike at Marikana, 
resulting in the deaths of 34 miners. Reuters/Siphiwe Sibeko”](https://images.theconversation.com/files/87188/original/image-20150702-11345-1o8jxtu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=926&fit=clip "illustration")

An example of photojournalists in an “embedded” position with police. 

In our case studies we will spend most of our time discussing what kinds of stories and information the media 
produces for us to attend to (**diversity and representation**) and how, when people pay attention to certain kinds
of stories together it can sometimes mobilise them to act jointly as a public (or publics). 

You will learn how traditional **public relations** and contemporary **influence industries** target both mass media
and social media platforms and can play an important role in shaping what people pay attention to, what is 
highlighted by the media, and what is on the agenda for public awareness and discussion (**agenda-setting** and 
**algorithmic culture**), as well as how the media presents stories to the public (**framing**).

Nonetheless, even when official media has been tightly controlled or when it primarily pursues profits while 
serving small wealthy elites, it remains extremely difficult to control what people think. Any attempts to 
influence people must contend with their powers of interpretation and the creativity of their everyday media 
practices. Even in situations of heavy repression, mass media are given significance in unofficial spaces where 
people **ridicule and resist official narratives** ([Nyamnjoh, 2005](ideas/references/index.html#nyamnjoh_2005)). 

For example, in apartheid South Africa, radio in indigenous languages was initially seen as a wartime way of 
rallying black audiences, and as “a tool to shape their perspective based on what served the minority white 
authorities” ([Nkoala, 2023]()). Nkoala argues that, instead of simply spreading **propaganda** as they were 
intended to do, these stations provided their audiences a way to resist being silenced and to speak and listen 
together.

We will also address how people are able to **mobilise** one another in collective action (for an optimistic perspective
on how social movements are enabled by digital media see [Castells, 2015](ideas/references/index.html#castells_2015)). Cell phones have become 
one of the most accessible form of media, and play a key role in the circulation of alternative and popular media such as memes, cartoons, music and citizen journalism. 
Haupt ([2018](/ideas/references/index.html#haupt_2018)) has shown how South African hip hop activists have 
used music to contest dominant representations of working-class black subjects. 

Clandestine uses of radio, posters, pamphlets, and graffiti also play an important role in expanding the range of discourses beyond media norms.

In later case studies we will explore the strategy of **culture-jamming** as a way for activists and artists (and you\!) 
to grab public attention and use surprise tactics and humour to get people talking and thinking about alternative ideas 
and counter-narratives and to imagine different ways of living and organising their societies together
([Haupt, 2008; 2017](/ideas/references/index.html#haupt_2008)).
