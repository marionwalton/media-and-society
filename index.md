# Media & Society

![Media student](img/cap.svg)

## What is a pocket textbook?
This is your [pocket textbook](/about/) for Media & Society. It's designed as an accessible, <button popovertarget="open">open access</button> guide to 
the ideas we'll explore in more detail in classes and course readings. 

The chapters are designed as a short, readable overview of the ideas we explore in the course.

We're currently testing this format and several of the topics are still under development. 
We'd love your [feedback or suggestions](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=NUNFkk5Wz0ywsCREW4wD9x3s_0Z6PpBKt8EXUBVHZFtUQjQyUjA3T0JWNlZPRElOVFpGRFFBVFFIOS4u).
