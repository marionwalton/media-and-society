# Media & Society

![Media student](img/cap.svg)
This is your [pocket textbook](/about/) for Media & Society. It's designed as an accessible guide to 
the ideas we'll explore in more detail in classes and course readings. 

Work through the chapters for an introduction to the ideas we explore in the course.

We're currently testing this format and several of the topics are still under development. 
We'd love your [feedback or suggestions](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=NUNFkk5Wz0ywsCREW4wD9x3s_0Z6PpBKt8EXUBVHZFtUQjQyUjA3T0JWNlZPRElOVFpGRFFBVFFIOS4u).
