# Media & Inequality
{: .no_toc }

*By Marion Walton, University of Cape Town*

The media both reflect and influence the many intersecting **social inequalities** we experience in the world
around us. This is particularly obvious if we look at the popular culture exported from the USA to the rest of
the world.

Traditionally, Hollywood stories featured very few protagonists of colour. For almost sixty
years (1937 \- 1992), Disney princesses were exclusively white. Black Panther, one of the first big budget 
films with a black superhero as protagonist, only appeared in 2018\. Furthermore, as Nyamnjoh explains, the 
industry built on a lengthy tradition of **colonial narratives and discourse** which justified white supremacy
and **othered and misrepresented** Africa and African people:  

>“Africa has through the centuries provided especially Euro-American cultural entrepreneurs with a rich catalogue 
of stereotypes, prejudices and other negations” ([Nyamnjoh, 2011:21](/ideas/references/index.html#nyamnjoh_2011)).

### Wealth inequality

Local news media also reflect many forms of inequality. As explained in our discussion of [attention](/ideas/2_attention/),
**advertisers** tend to target relatively wealthy people who have the disposable income to buy a wider range of products. 
Not everyone can afford to pay for broadband, subscriptions to news sites, satellite or streaming television. 
These are two examples of  **wealth inequality** in the media, which profoundly influences what kinds of 
stories are told, who can access them, and who is most likely to be a target audience for media productions. 

As a result, commercial media tends to be silent about the lives of people from low income groups, and their 
voices are seldom heard in news stories. These silences and absences work together with  **stereotypical 
representations,** **semiotic systems** and **discourses** which tend to construct the world in ways which 
favour the powerful (for more see about this, see O’Shaughnessy,  Stadler, & Casey, 2016: 56-86).


### Stereotypes

In African countries in particular, people’s media use has to contend with racism, colonialism and a range of
inequalities and stereotypical representations of the continent itself. Because media products and practices 
are often imported from the West, until recently, even middle class African media audiences have had limited
access to what Nyamnjoh (2011) calls “first-hand consumption” of cultural products \- in other words, the 
television programming and news on offer was often not produced specifically for them as audiences, and was 
probably riddled with potentially hurtful and stereotypical portrayals. 

Stereotypes are based on generalisations about specific categories of people. They can be both positive and 
negative but, either way, these generalisations tend to reinforce social hierarchies and identities. Stereotypical 
representations in the media continue to perpetuate forms of inequality such as racism, sexism and 
homophobia. 

These stereotypes persist because globally, the media have historically reflected the economic dominance of 
Hollywood industries (and increasingly of Silicon Valley) and catered to the beliefs and ideologies of white 
US audiences. Similarly, in South Africa the audiences often targeted by advertising and media are 
disproportionately middle class and often largely white. 

### AI, bias and inequality

Artificial intelligence models are [trained](/ideas/definitions/index.html#training) on data which 
includes media discourses. As a result, Generative AI continue to perpetuate existing racial and gendered biases 
present in their training data when they output **synthetic media**, as in Figure 1 below:

We will discuss these issues in detail, and explore ways to challenge these biases in other parts of the course. 

### Media, power and racism

Today, both traditional media and social media play a role in circulating and framing 
racist ideas as well as challenging racism ([Titley, 2019](href="/ideas/references/index.html#titley_2019")).

In Africa, the history of African media is associated with ideologies that underpin colonialism and neoliberal capitalism. 
Yet every day in African countries, people also use media to resist cultural domination by the large global media industries, 
and to express their cultural diversity (<a href="/ideas/references/index.html#nyamnjoh_2011">Nyamnjoh, 2011:21</a>).

### Media, power and sexism

Feminists have highlighted how a Hollywood film industry dominated by white men created conventions where white women in 
particular were viewed from the perspective of a cinematic "male gaze" (<a href="/ideas/references/index.html#mulvey_1975">Mulvey, 1975</a>)
which represents them primarily as sexual objects, for the visual pleasure of the heterosexual male viewer.

### The oppositional gaze

By contrast, in the Hollywood tradition, Black women were likely to be entirely excluded or represented as one-dimensional racist and sexist 
stereotypes (<a href="/ideas/references/index.html#hooks_1992">hooks, 1992</a>).

This history of inequality doesn’t mean that people’s thinking is controlled by the media they encounter. 

For example, Black feminist theorist bell hooks remembers watching movies as a young Black girl 
in the USA and becoming aware that black women were excluded from the male gaze while white women were idealised. 
This led her to develop the idea of an **"oppositional gaze"** where the act of spectatorship becomes 
a gesture of resistance (<a href="/ideas/references/index.html#hooks_1992">hooks, 1992</a>). 


## Questions

* What stereotypes have you personally found harmful or hurtful?  
* What did you notice was missing from the media as you were growing up?  
* How have you encountered stereotypical representations of wealth, race, language, gender and sexuality in the media you use every day?   
* Do you have any media practices of your own which help you address these inequalities?
