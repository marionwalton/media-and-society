## people using media
*By Marion Walton, University of Cape Town*

Our everyday rituals and habits around media use and production are linked to the **media practices** that we learn 
by belonging to various social groups and communities. 

### Everyday media practices

Media practices are activities, habits and routines where people use media (individually or 
together) as part of a socially meaningful activity. Many of these practices involve being together with others
while we consume, create, use, or play with media. 

To study media practices, we need to pay attention to what people are up to and why they use media in the ways that they do: 

>“What, quite simply, are people doing in relation to media across a whole range of situations and contexts?” 
(Couldry 2004: 119). 

Just as you have learned how to dress for particular family occasions, or how to tell jokes in a way that will make 
your friends laugh, or when it’s appropriate to switch from one language to another at school, you will have 
learned **media practices** from other people around you. From a young age you’ve been learning the significance 
of particular media, such as how playing a video game, or knowledge of music or a television series can increase (or sometimes decrease!) your status
in your friends group. When you get to know new groups of people (such as academics and students at university) you'll also learn what media 
means in their everyday lives.

Some media practices play a role in fostering people’s sense of **togetherness.** For example, families gather
around a favourite television series, friends go out to watch a sports game on television and relative strangers 
often hang out together online playing video games or watching a livestream of someone else playing. 

People also use media to create privacy when they are surrounded by other people or to signal to others that their attention is elsewhere or to focus their attention.
For example, teens use their cellphones to create a bubble of privacy for themselves and their friends while
living with their families ([Ito et al, 2005](/ideas/references/index.html#ito_et_al_2005)).

The cartoon in Figure 1 pokes fun at family 
media viewing practices, showing how families combine television viewing with
contemporary individual cellphone use. In such cases, it's not always clear whether it's the television or the cellphones which are acting as a "second screen" ([Guo, 2019](/ideas/references/index.html#guo_2019)).

mean in your friends group? 

### Everyday practices in SA

As part of your everyday routine, you may also have **created media** by sending a  message to a friend on 
a messaging app, scribbling a note to yourself, using a search engine, taking a photograph or video and sharing 
it with other people in the form of **social media** content posted to a social network site. 

You may wonder how your own media practices compare to those of others around you. People’s everyday media practices 
differ greatly depending on whether they can read and write, which languages they understand, whether they have easy 
and affordable access to fast internet and how old they were when they first learned to use the internet. 

### Language and media 

The news media landscape in South Africa is dominated by publications in English, and (to a lesser extent) Afrikaans.
Broadcasting is somewhat more diverse, mostly because the public broadcaster (SABC) is required to provide information in all the
official languages ([SABC, 2024](/ideas/references/index.html#sabc_2024).

Thus the languages used in mass media look very different to the languages which people actually speak.

 Use the Statssa chart (Figure 2) to work out how many people in South Africa speak your first language. Which language/s do you
  use for news and entertainment?  Check your knowledge by filling in the Exercise 2 at the bottom of the page. 
  
### Digital inequalities

Differences in internet access create [digital inequalities](/ideas/definitions/#digital_inequality) (also known as the **digital divide**). 
Such inequalities tend to reflect other **social inequalities** such as age, gender, and whether people live in cities, towns or small 
villages. For example, according to a recent survey, only 64% of South Africans used the Internet in 2021 ([GWI, 2022](/ideas/references/index.html#gwi_2022)). 
The study found that Internet users are most likely to be younger (16-24 yrs old) urban dwellers in full-time 
employment. By contrast, it found that only a small minority of older people in South Africa go online \- only 
about 1 in 20 internet users in the country are older than 55\.

South Africa also has relatively **high prices for mobile data**, and so, in lower income groups in particular, people 
are “less connected” and their access to the internet is highly constrained ([de Lanerolle, et al, 2017](/ideas/references/index.html#de_lanerolle_et_al_2017)) 

**Radio** is a far more easily accessible medium in this context. A recent survey found that around 94% of South 
Africans (15+) owned a radio, and millions of people tune in regularly to a wide range of public and community 
stations, of which  indigenous language stations attract the largest audiences. Nonetheless, people’s listening 
practices are shifting as they turn to online radio and podcasts ([Nkoala, 2023](/ideas/references/index.html#nkoala_2023)).

### Online media practices

According to the GWI ([2022](/ideas/references/index.html#gwi_2022)) study, those South Africans who do use the internet spent considerably more time every 
day on social media (3:41 hours) compared to their counterparts in the rest of the world (2.28 hours). The survey 
also found that internet users in South Africa were more likely to read the news online (0:55 hours) than in print 
(0:37 hours). They also spent more time streaming music (2.14) than listening to the radio (1.31). Yet these internet
users were still watching a lot of broadcast television (e.g. SABC or DSTV), which they watched for an average of 
2:29 hrs every day. By comparison they watched streaming video or TV series (e.g. Youtube, Netflix or Showmax, in 
that order), for an average of 1.48 hrs per day. 

More recently in 2024, the MAPS™ survey ([MAPS, 2024](/ideas/references/index.html#maps_2024)) shows these numbers growing, with 
almost three quarters of South Africans regularly engaging on social media platforms, and 13 million people reporting that they spent
more than 20 hours a week on social media.
- Facebook (29 million users), 
- WhatsApp (26 million users), 
- TikTok (12 million users) 

Of those people who do go online, a smaller proportion (12.8 million people) watched video content such as Youtube or streaming television in the previous week.
